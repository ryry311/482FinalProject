Simply, it interrogates disputes over contracts, property (as well as intellectual property), personal injury, and the breakdown of family relations are conversant examples of civil disputes. The civil justice system is characterised by a distinct dispute resolution and law enforcement functions, although these functions are not always explicit and their relationship can be vague. People normally turn to this legal system to address an \u2018injustice\u2019 situation they encounter. This makes civil justice both socially and economically important, as it may be driven by efficiency or access to justice concerns. The literature suggests that law reform has an uninspiring record in this field. This is so because it has, largely, not been considered with a detailed empirically informed evaluation of proposed solutions. This legal system is really complex, and research in this field is correspondingly challenging, interesting and important. Hence, the need for an edited collection of original research in this area.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOBJECTIVE:This book aims to provide significant empirical research findings, as well as theoretical reviews and frameworks on civil justice. It will be written for scholars, professionals, and students who want to improve their understanding of civil justice issues through solid research findings. The book will also provide insights and support experts in their numerous academic and professional endeavours.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTARGET AUDIENCE:The target audience of this book will be composed of professionals and researchers working in the field of law, socio-legal studies, sociology, anthropology, political science, social work, social policy, economics, and criminal justice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRECOMMENDED TOPICS:Studying civil justiceCivil justice reform debateJudicial reformPersonal injuryProperty (including Intellectual property)Contracts and accessibility of contract lawLegal need- access to justiceCourts and procedures: civilian and common law traditionsCost and delay in the courtsAlternate dispute resolutionProcedural justiceLegal representationLegal feesCase management\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSubmission Procedure\nResearchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before\u00a0March 16, 2020,\u00a0a chapter proposal of 1,000 words or less clearly explaining the aim, underpinning theory (ies), methodology, and some preliminary findings (if applicable) of his or her proposed chapter.

However, whilst the use of still and moving images has been spreading, especially since the wider use of social media and open practices in Higher Education in the UK and other parts of the world, there is a need to clarify and explore the benefits, potential challenges and barriers offered for learning through more creative visual representations. More and more, academics and other professionals who teach or support learning in universities are often intrigued to find out more about the potential offered through visual methods in their practice to enhance their teaching and create stimulating learning experiences for learners in face-to-face and online settings.\nThere has been a growing interest in using visual representation in teaching and work such as that of Mayer (2014) on Multimedia learning offers some guiding principles such as the various ways in which words and pictures can be used to enhance learning as does Jewitt\u2019s (2012) approach to multimedia model of learning using digital technologies. The influential theory of Clark and Pavio (1991), the dual-coding theory, has also gained wide acceptance and suggests that it is easier to understand something when we combine verbal and non-verbal elements. The implications of this are obvious for teaching in most educational settings including university, especially with an ever- growing interest in enhancing learner experiences.\nThis Special Issue aims to go deeper in exploring the potential uses of visual representation in teaching and learning and the implications for practice in the context of higher education while showcasing the emerging work and research in this area from around the world.\nWe welcome articles from new and more experienced academic writers, practitioners and researchers who have been creating, using and adapting various forms of visual representation across the disciplines and professional areas. We also invitestudents who are using them for their learning at undergraduate, postgraduate or doctoral level, from around the world and would like to share their work with a wider audience through an open access issue to help us all gain new insights and deepen our understandings in this area.\nWe will consider the following types of contributions:\nReflective articles (1000-3000 words)Research papers (3000-5000 words)Viewpoints (2000-3000 words)Innovative practice papers (3000-4000 words)We strongly encourage authors to include visual representations which relate to their work.The deadline to submit your article is 30 May 2020.

The limitations of our own corporeality can be abolished or the ground rules changed to give us new experiences.\u201d\u00a0\nKathryn Hume, Fantasy and Mimesis\nWhere readers once understood heroism through a Gilgamesh, a Frodo or a Katniss, the digital subject can now figure heroism through actions, decisions and events that are in many ways their own. Video gaming has an especial talent for creating heroes that are lived-through by their users, whether this is via the experience of leading characters such as Link through the temples of Hyrule; via choice-based play utilising avatars such as Frisk of Undertale fame; or by creating entirely unique personas in role play games such as Dragon Age. In a contemporary moment enabled and mediated by a multiplicity of digital spaces, the way we conceptualize heroism will be both enabled and contaminated by games, the virtual, and ever-increasing screentime. The realm of the digital, functioning as a receptacle of imagination can equip players with the means to express the self. \u00a0Digital spaces can serve as a conduit for both ludic and fantastical impulses. Heroic research must adapt to this interactive environment \u2013 its places, its communities, its values \u2013 if it is to keep a handle on the heroic constellation formed of informatic, computational and digital materials.\u00a0\nFantasy scholars and authors alike have sought to define the Fantasy genre. Whether that be as experienced by characters as \u2018hesitation\u2019 (Todorov, 1970), a loose genre that can be described as\u00a0 a \u2018fuzzy set\u2019 (Attebery, 1992), or as being \u2018the mirror of mimetic literature and its inner soul\u2019 (Mendlesohn, 2008), digital iterations of fantasy have enhanced and extended our capability to experience the immersion of fantastic worlds. Though Fantasy video games may pay tribute to the literature from which it sprang, each form with its differing modes of performance allows the Fantastic an opportunity be presented in all of its heterogeneity; players are given the opportunity to experience a new kind of protagonism, a heroism that enables the player to effect and interact with fantasy narratives. The interactivity offered by video games can enable players to experience the self in new ways, whether that be through choice-based narratives, the player-led exploration of a Walking-Simulator or via avatars which enable players to live the \u2018posthuman fantasy of extending the human subject beyond itself\u2019 (Boulter, 2015) and craft fantasy personas.\u00a0\nThe symposium will be seeking submissions for 15 min papers accompanying creative workshops (1 hour) on themes such as, but not limited to, the following topics:\nDefining/constructing digital heroism\u00a0The converging interests of fantasy and digital heroism\u00a0Digital and fantastic video game environments and their effect on heroism\u00a0Fantasy video games and avatar creation\u00a0Fantastic VR experiences, the self, and digital heroism\u00a0The social/theoretical implications of digital iterations of fantasy\u00a0Considerations of digital spaces as fantastic ones\u00a0Heroic fantasy video game character(istics)\u00a0Considerations of what heroism means in the digital age\u00a0Problems with digital heroismDigital heroism examined through:Convergence culture\u00a0Participatory cultureFeminismPostcolonialism\u00a0Queer Studies\u00a0Disability Studies\u00a0\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES\u00a0\nDigital Heroisms will run with the view to contributing a special issue to the student video game journal Press Start.

Our highly trained and passionate staff educate coffee consumers on creating their best cup of coffee at home without many hassles. We do not support any specific brands, so you can be ensured that our reviews will be impartial and honest.\nSince coffee comes in a range of varieties, you need to understand what you want in your daily cup and this will help you decide what you need to buy. Firstly, you need to buy coffee in bean form, grind it and brew it effectively for the best results. How you choose your brewing vessel and method depends on your coffee habits and needs to be decided by considering your crucial requirements. If you live in a big family, a drip coffee maker that has a special storage section for beans and single-button grinding will be a great choice. If you like your coffee strong, the French percolator or press method that retains coffee in hot water longer and creates higher caffeine content will be a good one for you.\nA great place to begin after your purchase of a coffee maker is buying sealed coffee storage boxes, measuring spoons, thermal cups, accessory organizers, brewing guides and a professional style grinder. Following the basics initially will help you save money and time in the long run.\n\n https://mycoffeemachine.com/\n\n\n jt810780@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "The Globalization and Localization in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (GLoCALL) 2020", "location": "Kuala Lumpur", "organization": "Organization: HELP University", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-08-06\r\n                        to 2020-08-08", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-31", "description": "The program committee of GLoCALL 2020, sponsored by PacCALL and the local host, invites proposals for presentations that are related to computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and/or technology-enhanced language learning (TELL).\u00a0\nProposals for Papers (25 minutes), Workshops (60 minutes), Symposia (60 minutes), Posters (60 minutes) and Virtual Presentations (a file that is shared with all participants via the GLoCALL website) should be submitted to the GLoCALL 2020 Submissions database by 31st March, 2020.\n\u00a0\nProposals are encouraged within the sub-themes below, but are not limited to them.\n\u00a0\napplication of technology to the language classroom\nlocalizing Internet materials to the classroom\nusing the Internet for cultural exchange\nmanaging multimedia/hypermedia environments\ne-learning, collaborative learning, and blended learning\nemerging technologies\nfostering autonomous learning through technology\ntraining language teachers in e-learning environments\nFor this conference, we will be publishing two special issues in reputable CALL journals -- one in EJCALL (indexed in Scopus) and the other in IJCALLT (indexed in Australian Education Index).

Be it the Maccabean revolt, Gandhi's practice of non-violence resistance, contemporary neo-pagan religions, or the counter-system movements portrayed by Mark Juergensmeyer in his 2001 book Terror in the Mind of God, religious beliefs have motivated people to reject social order that\u00a0they deem as unjust, and possibly rise against it. Even in today\u2019s secularized societies, religion has served as the ground for social movements and manifestations addressing pressing socio-economic threats such as climate change, social inequality, authoritarian governments and minority discrimination. These observations have encouraged new trends in scholarly debate, especially regarding the emergence of alternative religious ideas and rituals in modern societies. How have old and new religious convictions legitimized various resistance movements among different communities? Which causes have influenced violent mobilizations against the established social order, non-violent struggle, or the establishment of alternative community frameworks? What can these movements and ideas tell us about the role that religion plays today both in secularized and non-secularized societies? The conference invites contributions to studying the conceptualization, management, and instrumentalization of religious ideas and beliefs with regard to past and contemporary resistance movements.\nFind further information in the link below\nFor further information\nPlease address the student organizers Juan Manuel Rubio Arevalo, Krisztina Bodz\u00e1sn\u00e9 Cs\u00e9nyi-Nagy, and Jan Trt\u00edlek\nby e-mail at\ncrsconference2020@ceu.edu\n\n https://religion.ceu.edu/crs-elte-muni-phd-conference-25-27-june-2020?fbclid=IwAR2DQupwnSEbOl7EHoKaRZBBKiX_k9k8D_sk3q842HdROETkzNUVLurHU9M\n\n\n crsconference2020@ceu.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTEGRATION OF THE WESTERN BALKANS INTO THE EU ", "location": "Pristina", "organization": "Organization: AAB College ", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-29\r\n                        to 2020-05-30", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-05", "description": "Call for papersOrganizer:AAB COLLEGE in partnership with:South East European University, Tetovo (North Macedonia)Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek (Croatia)University of Sarajevo (Bosnia and Hercegovina)Kosovo Academy for Public Safety (Kosovo)Mediterranean University, Tirana (Albania)University \u201dAleksand\u00ebr Moisiu\u201d, Durr\u00ebs (Albania)FON University, Skopje (North Macedonia)Tirana Business University, (Albania)\u00a0KEYNOTE SPEAKERSProf. Dr. Blerim Reka, Minister of\u00a0European Integration of KosovoProf. Asoc.

The European perspective is a commitment not only to the politics of these countries, but it is also a great expectation of the citizens of these countries.\nExcept for some EU Member States (such as Bulgaria, Romania), the EU has set specific conditions for Western Balkan countries. Western Balkan countries known as sensitive countries due to the involvement of some of them in conflicts of the past century, the difficulties in their consolidation or the efforts of stability of bilateral agreements, continue to remain in limbo in the Euro-integration process even though they are in the European continent and consisting of cultural diversity within a small space.\nThe Western Balkan region reveals special trends in the EU\u2019s handling of the strategy of political conditionality, and some creeping contradictions and dangers are beginning to reveal the changing nature and the limits of conditionality. More specifically, the EU is adding further, yet necessary, political conditions and criteria to weaker or more reluctant partners and emphasizes the \u2018journey\u2019 rather than the outcome of accession, affecting the credibility of the strategy (Anastasakis, 2008).\nThis strategy in the post-conflict Balkans, since 2000, has been a conditionality approach based on a dual strategy: state-building and, European integration (Bieber, 2011) for countries such as Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. Preservation and consolidation of several international agreements, including the Dayton Agreement and then the Prespa Agreement; the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law, the most effective results in combating crime and corruption; reforms to dynamic and efficient administration and harmonization of national legislation with those of the acquis communautaire in these former socialist countries; development, economic sustainability, unemployment, and emigration are issues that these countries continue to face and are subject to conditionality by the EU. For Kosovo, state-building and state-consolidation at an early stage, but also reaching a final agreement between Pristina and Belgrade recently, are still unresolved issues.\nThe Western Balkan countries, a notion of the EU, which are surrounded by member states, are left as a dead end on the European continent, while Kosovo residents have been left most isolated on the continent due to the visa regime. Developments of the past decade, including international media coverage, seem to have extended the inertia of the former image, perceiving the region as turbulent even after decades of stabilization. The EU in its annual Progress Report identifies developments in these countries and progress made in some areas, but criticizes the failure of national policies to do their \u201chomework\u201d. But there are also complaints from these countries of non-principled standards from Brussels, adding to the pessimistic voices about the European future of the region after Brexit. Economic development, trade exchanges, investment, unemployment, etc., are another dimension of the Western Balkan countries, as are some countries\u2019 initiatives to open up within an area called mini-Schengen; including the security component, in the age of terrorism, refugees, migration and cyber insecurity, which are another dimension as well.\nEconomic and political integration into the EU has become one of the biggest challenges for the Western Balkan countries, and the situation has worsened since the 2008 economic crisis. The difficult economic situation combined with inherited political problems has created great discrepancies in the countries of this region in terms of benefits deriving from the EU. This situation has contributed to some states to expand and increase their influence in the region.\nThese issues portray some of the main perspectives of the conference which aims to bring together scholars from the countries of the region and international experts to present their studies and views on the issues of EU integration of the region; exchange experiences, ideas and discuss other relevant issues related to the conference topics.\nThe main purpose of the conference is to bring together scholars from different fields in the region to present their scientific views and results on an important issue such as the integration of Western Balkan countries into the EU.\nAll interested parties are invited to send an abstract with a length of 200-250 words, in English, Albanian or Bosnian language.\nWe welcome presentations that describe the original work on any of the topics listed above. Acceptance of abstracts will be based on the relevant quality to the conference\u2019s topics and authenticity. The conference program will include oral presentations and posters in the duration of 15-20 minutes in separate sessions.\nWe are pleased to invite scholars in the fields of political science and international relations, economics, law, European law, communications, etc., but also policymakers, political and decision-makers, to focus on the following topics, which relate to the theme of the conference:\n- The EU\u2019s role in economic developments in the Western Balkans- The role of the private sector in enhancing competitive capacity in the international market- Transparency as a factor for enhancing international economic cooperation- The role of government in developing economic and integration policies- International economic systems and their impact on integration processes- The barriers of post-war economies to developed economies of EU countries \u2013 policies and effects- European stability and the Balkans as a fragile region- Rule of law in the Western Balkans- Western Balkans: ghetto or part of the continent \u2013 membership perspectives- Corruption as an obstacle to European integration- Effective public administration and overloaded administration in the Western Balkans- Harmonization of state legislation with EU legislation- Economic development and living standards: an obstacle or pretext for European integration of the region- Image of the Balkans in Europe, public discussions and media coverage- Good neighborliness as a condition towards integration: challenges and difficulties- International and regional organizations in the Balkans- Democracy and democratization of countries in the region- Minorities and their situation in the Balkan countries- Law and order in the region- Migration- Civil society and its impact on developments in the Balkans, including the media- Domestic economies and their relationships with international financial organizations- Degraded postwar economies- Post-war economies and privatization processes- Population movements and migration as a trend- Organized crime and corruption- Free elections as a contribution to democracy- Mini-Schengen as an integration initiative- Harmonization of the existing Western Balkan countries legislation with EU legislation- Free market and tariffs- Refugees in the Western Balkans- Dialogue of neighboring countries- Geopolitics and geostrategy for the Western Balkans and the role of non-European actorsUSA and the Balkans- Quality of education in Western Balkan countries, reforms, and challenges- Reforming public administration in the Western Balkans.PURPOSEThe main purpose of the conference is to bring together scholars from different fields in the region to present their scientific views and results on an important issue such as the integration of Western Balkan countries into the EU.All interested parties are invited to send an abstract with a length of 200-250 words, in English, Albanian or Bosnian language.We welcome presentations that describe the original work on any of the topics listed above.

They pursue key initiatives for developing generations of scholars and practitioners. The teaching-learning act itself is a process of knowledge sharing with and between students. Knowledge Management (KM) principles, strategies, models, tools, and techniques have been proven in government, business and industry. More recently KM has emerged as an essential enabler for the successful pursuit of scholarly activities in higher education. This handbook of research focuses on the investigation of the adoption of KM principles, strategies, models, tools, and techniques in all aspects of higher education.\nThe purpose of this book is to present an opportunity for both academic and practitioner-scholars to present original, unpublished research articles related to knowledge management in Higher Education.\nAn academic institution has multiple stakeholders -- faculty, students, management, staff, regulatory authorities, industry partners and the community in which it exists. There are two thrusts of focus at these institutions. The first that come to mind are research, teaching, learning, and service. These are the result of multiple, interconnected processes that involve these stakeholders, such as those related to scholarly research and teaching. The second less visible aspects are those supporting administration: student enrollment, retention, graduation, and placement, institution and program administration and governance, fundraising, grants processing, facilities management, alumni relationship management, and international relationships to name a few.\nKnowledge management has significant contributions to make in capturing, storing, processing, and disseminating knowledge between and across these stakeholder entities and their processes to better support these inter-related processes and activities. Given the impetus provided by the United Nations - Global Knowledge Economy Policy, institutions worldwide are actively pursuing the use of Knowledge Management in all facets of social and economic development. The importance of KM research and application in academia is a critical element of this multifaceted endeavor.\nThis handbook positions itself as a compendium of cutting-edge research on the use of Knowledge Management in Higher Education. It will provide a comprehensive forum for publishing original, theoretical and application-oriented research within the Higher Education application domain. Its target audience includes KM researchers and practitioners and, the range of different stakeholders at academic institutions of higher learning.\nWe welcome both qualitative and quantitative submissions. We hope that this compendium will prove to be a useful and thought-provoking reference for students, researchers, and practitioners of KM, particularly for those with interest in Higher Education.\nThe audience of this book will include researchers and practitioners working in the fields of Higher Education and Knowledge Management. The book will be a handbook for academics, analysts, developer, students, technologists, education consultants, and enthusiastic readers seeking to learn, improve and expand their theoretical and applied knowledge of KM tools and techniques, models, processes, systems in Higher Education.\nTopics can include, but are not limited to, the following:\n1. Knowledge Management in Higher Education:\n2. Knowledge Management Strategies for Higher Education:\n3. Applications of KM in Higher Education delivery:\n4. Knowledge Management Tools, Techniques and Methods in ICT \u2013 Higher Education perspectives:\n5. Challenges and Issues related to KM implementation in Academia:\n6. Case Studies of KM implementation in Higher Education\n7. Best Practices for KM Adoption in Higher Education\n8. Other Relevant\nTarget Audience\nThe target audience of this book will be composed of professionals and researchers working in the field of information and knowledge management in various disciplines, e.g. library, information and communication sciences, administrative sciences and management, education, adult education, sociology, computer science, and information technology. Moreover, the book will provide insights and support executives concerned with the management of expertise, knowledge, information and organizational development in different types of work communities and environments.\nSubmission Procedure\nWe invite researchers and practitioners to submit on or before Apr 14, 2020 a chapter proposal of 1,000 to 2,000 words clearly explaining the mission and concerns of his or her proposed chapter.

Such new representations make it possible to probe the hidden connections behind large sets of data and reconfigure them in temporal and spatial dimensions that are unnoticed before. The use of digital technologies also helps uncover the visual and interactive nature of the hidden connections. Put simply, it is the digital database that has demonstrated its power in uncovering new relations and in presenting new images.\n\u00a0\nThe revolutions digital representations have brought about are not limited to new modes of representation, they also are capable of showing new connections in relations. All such changes demand new research methodologies that look at data beyond texts. When text representation is replaced by images and when connections are supplemented by database generated relations, what will be the role of critical interpretations? What will remain to be done in close reading? New research methodologies in digital humanities have posed questions that challenge not only data management, data curation, text encoding and extraction, but also new conceptions of critical interpretation.

The series has demonstrated the wide-spread nature of the air pollution phenomena and has explored in depth their impacts on human health and the environment.\u00a0\nGrowing urbanization &deteriorating air quality is posing the most dangerous health issues in India. A common type of air pollution happens when people release particles into the air from burning fuels. This pollution looks like soot. containing millions of tiny particles. floating in the air. Another common type of air pollution is dangerous gases, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides. and chemical vapors. These can take part in further chemical reactions once they are in the atmosphere, creating acid rain and smog. Other sources of air pollution can come from within buildings, such as second-hand smoke.\u00a0\nThere are some effective methods which are used to control air pollution. These are used to filter and purify the air which is polluted. Diffusion of the contaminants in the atmosphere is another approach to the control of air pollution. Dilution of pollutants in air depends on atmosphere temperature, speed, and direction of the wind. Vegetation is another way to control air pollution by utilizing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen in the form of photosynthesis.\nConference on Air Pollution Control is aimed to bring together the leading academic scientists, researchers and research scholars to exchange, share their experiences and research results on all aspects of air pollution and control. It will also provide a premier interdisciplinary platform for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends. and concerns as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the fields of air pollution and control.\nWHO SHOULD SPONSOR/EXHIBIT?\nAir pollution modeling,\u00a0Air pollution mitigation and management,\u00a0Indoor air pollution control,\u00a0Air data quality monitoring & measuring equipment,\u00a0Air pollution control technologies,\u00a0GIS & remote sensing applications,\u00a0Flue- gas scrubbing and air extraction,\u00a0Noise reduction/ Sound insulation,\u00a0Analysis laboratories,\u00a0Aid organization,\u00a0Veg.

Current European and Global Perspectives\nCall for Papers\n\u00a0\nWhere: Berlin, Catholic Academy in Berlin\nWhen: September 17 to 18, 2020\n\u00a0\nConcept\nThe year 1945 marks a turning point in world history. The defeat of Germany and the end of Nazism as well as the defeat of Japan 75 years ago, and its militaristic dictatorship, signified the end of the Second World War, which Hitler had unleashed six years earlier, assisted by Stalin. Conducted on an unprecedented criminal scale, the Second World War and the Holocaust saw the sacrifice of millions of lives. Material losses were immeasurable. Both during and after the war, millions of people were forced to migrate from their homeland. For Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the war was also directly associated with the beginning of the communist dictatorship. To the present day, the year 1945 remains firmly established as a turning point in the collective memory, both within Europe and far beyond. Nevertheless, this memory could never be described as being consistent; it exhibits very different, changing emphases and perspectives across many various countries. The vivid memories of the Second World War and its end have faded with the passing of time and the generation of witnesses. Faced with new political and ecological challenges, the motivation for peace that shaped Europe over subsequent decades is being increasingly pushed into the background.\n\u00a0\nThe conference will focus on the shifts in memories and changes in perspectives regarding the end of the Second World War observed over the last two decades. What are the effects and the impacts of these in the current day? Assessment of these events has transformed over the course of the 21st century against the background of the expansion of the European Union and its present day state of crisis, together with new political challenges and the reorientation of memorial culture. The intention is to enumerate these developments, to analyse their causes, and to discuss their consequences, not least with regard to points of reference for a collective remembering of the year 1945.\n\u00a0\nPapers dealing with the end of the war are sought under the following thematic areas, comparative examinations are welcome:\n(Re)Assessments of the end of the war within historiography.The Second World War was a global phenomenon. Questions for discussion might include:- What impact did the 1989 end of confrontation between the West and the Eastern Bloc have on historiography?\n- Are there new and further aspects for consideration in interpretations of end of the war?\n- To what extent does research interact and exert influence across Eastern, Central and Western Europe?\n- What historiographical developments are identifiable (across the world)?\nMuseums, memorials, portrayal of the end of the war in the media and school curricula:- How do museums and memorial sites present the subject area?\n- What forms of memory-political developments are associated with the (re)construction and redesigning of museums and memorial sites?\n- What changes have occurred in requirements for and demands on museums and educational work (digitalisation, narrative character etc.)\n- Is it possible to portray the end of the war consistently across the world?\n- How do schools teach the end of the war?\n- What role do the media play in communicating certain views of history?\nConflicts in collective memory concerning the end of the war:- How do different perceptions and sensitivities manifest themselves in this area?- How do people deal with the concept of \u2018liberation\u2019? \u2018Liberation\u2019 from what and why?\n- What stake do churches have in the communication process?- Are there any new \u2018blind spots\u2019 or taboo areas?- What direction and form is current historical dialogue taking (institutions, remembrance networks)?\n\u00a0\nTarget audience: This academically based conference is designed for those who are interested in cultural and historical-political focussed analysis and discussion of this era and subject area.

Ben Barres\u2019 The Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist provides insights into the lived experience of a prominent scientist who was transgender. This new book extends that work by fostering novel insights into science and technology by viewing them through specifically transgender perspectives. Confirmed contributors include leading scholars in transgender studies, such as University of California, Davis historian of science Howard Chiang, editor of Transgender China and member of the editorial board of TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly.\nInterested authors should send a 300-word abstract, 200-word biography, and sample of a previously published chapter or article to Dr. Douglas Vakoch at dvakoch@meti.org by April 20, 2020. Authors will be notified whether their proposals are accepted by April 30, 2020. First drafts of full chapters (8,000 words) are due by November 1, 2020, and final versions are due January 15, 2021. Both transgender and cisgender contributors are welcome. Preference will be given to authors who have completed their doctorates. Only previously unpublished works will be considered. \nThis volume is modeled after Dr. Vakoch\u2019s earlier book Transecology: Transgender Perspectives on Environment and Nature. Contributors to that book used major concepts from both ecology and gender studies to examine intimacy, connection, exclusion, identity, and emplacement. For example, these chapters examined Susan Stryker\u2019s notion of trans identity as \u201contologically inescapable,\u201d Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of \u201cmesh\u201d to explore the interconnectedness of all beings, Stacy Alaimo\u2019s notion of \u201ctrans-corporeality\u201d as a \u201ccontact zone\u201d between humans and the environment, Judith Butler\u2019s analysis of gender as \u201cperformative,\u201d with those who are not \u201cproperly gendered\u201d being seen as \u201cabjects\u201d\u2014and Julia Serano\u2019s contrasting rejection of gender as performance.\nIn a similar manner, for Transgender Science and Technology we are seeking proposals that examine the specific science or technology that is the focus of each chapter using insights from transgender theory and experience. The core question that motivates the book is \u201cHow can we better understand the nature and development of specific sciences and technologies through a transgender lens?\u201d Proposals that explicitly critique cisnormativity and cissexism are especially welcome.\nWe are seeking contributions from an international group of scholars representing a range of disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences, and technology\u2014as well as fields that study and critique these disciplines\u2014including but not limited to anthropology, astronomy, biology, biotechnology, chemistry, computer science, ecology, economics, engineering, environmental studies, gender studies, geography, geology, history and philosophy of science, information technology, mathematics, medicine, physics, political science, psychology, public health, queer studies, science and technology studies, sociology, sociology of science, and transgender studies.\nThe editor of Transgender Science and Technology, Dr. Douglas Vakoch, is president of METI, a scientific organization dedicated to Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence, as well as professor emeritus of clinical psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies. His sixteen previous edited books include The Drake Equation: Estimating the Prevalence of Extraterrestrial Life Through the Ages (Cambridge University Press, 2015), Ecopsychology, Phenomenology, and the Environment (Springer, 2014), Archaeology, Anthropology, and Interstellar Communication (NASA, 2014), and Psychology of Space Exploration (NASA, 2011).

In fact, this multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary form that has persistently accompanied the different phases in the evolution of \u201cprint-capitalism\u201d has hardly been analysed from a theoretical perspective. This dismissal by the academic world is certainly peculiar, if not manifestly contradictory; however, it significantly testifies of the difficulty of investigating such a slippery object of study critically.\nThe very \u2018physiognomy\u2019 of the book or film review, inherently wavering between the duty to inform and the needs of the market, influenced as it is by the definition of \u2018taste\u2019, makes this form difficult to tackle with a sound methodological approach. Since the beginning of the XVIII century, the book and film review has proved to be an essential interface between cultural supply and demand, and it has always been something more than a weapon to reach fame and recognition. Depending of the position gained in the literary or film fields, the review has often determined the success or failure of a creative enterprise, of a name or reputation. This particular device has been the yardstick of the most diverse sensibilities and tempers, from the learned expert to the passionate amateur. In this, its proliferation has foreshadowed the changes in the reception processes of works no longer provided with an \u2018aura\u2019 and therefore prone to the whims of a mass audience, whose judgments ultimately assessed their value.\nFor these reasons, it is hard to trace the evolution of the \u2018review form\u2019 from a single point of view while focusing on the mechanisms that have triggered its fortune. As a crucial touchstone of intellectual production, the review still performs its essential normative function, contributing to outlining the ever-evolving \u201chorizon of expectations\u201d of its audiences, often identified with an ideal corpus which should epitomise a shared canon. On the other hand, as a social process, the review tends to keep track of the continuing dialectics between mainstream aesthetic values and their renegotiation in distinct contexts and/or communities of consumption.\nIn the light of the rapidly-changing scenario of media and technologies, the conference \u201cBook Reviews and Beyond\u201d aims at exploring this compelling area of research in accordance with the interdisciplinary perspective of periodical studies, with particular focus on the period from the eighteenth century to the turn of the new millennium.\nThe topics that will be discussed include, but are by no means limited to:\nScientific Committee:Paolo GiovannettiAndrea ChiuratoMara Logaldo\nOrganizing Committee:Dario BoemiaStefano LocatiLaura Sica\nDeadline for submissions31 March, 2020\nPlease submit a 350-500 words abstract (with brief author bio and affiliation, 100 words) in English or Italian to beyondbookreview2020@gmail.com.

But how does documentary respond to what has been widely diagnosed as the current crisis of democracy? How does documentary react to the return to nationalism and other forms of political tribalism in the face of global migration? How does documentary shape our perceptions of the consequences of globalization, from climate change to the transformation of the economy? And how can documentary in theory and practice contribute to defend the space and modes of deliberation necessary for the life of democracy?\nVisible Evidence, the international conference on documentary film and media, now in its 27th year, will convene in Frankfurt, Germany, on December 16-19, 2020. Hosted by the Institute for Theatre, Film and Media Studies (TFM) at Goethe University, Frankfurt, Visible Evidence XXVII will address these and other current issues related to the history, theory, practice and pedagogy of documentary and non-fiction cinema, television, video, audio recording, digital media, photography, VR, games and performance in a wide range of panels, workshops, plenary sessions, screenings and special events. We welcome panel, workshop, screening and paper proposals that address documentary and non-fiction media from a diverse range of disciplines that open the field to new lines of investigation through innovative and original perspectives.\nDesigned as a public event open to the citizens of Frankfurt, the conference makes a conscious nod towards documentary history as an instrument of public opinion. The notion of crisis, a thread weaved through the history of documentary, calls for new political, formal and social possibilities that consolidate and expand documentary\u2019s role as a space for representation and democratic deliberation. These new possibilities should be explored in a dialogue between theory and practice. We invite scholars, filmmakers, archivists and activists to propose panels and presentations that address any aspect of documentary and non-fiction media. Special thread and themes may include (but are in no way limited to):\nDocumentary and Conflict: How should we perceive conflict not just as a historically-specific geopolitical crisis, but as an interaction of aesthetic forces that reorders documentary temporalities, geographies and speech-acts? What role is taken by documentary in an age of rising fascism, post- and neo-colonialism, transnational military interventions and global humanitarianism?\nDocumentary Infrastructures: How does documentary depict and expose industrial infrastructures? In what ways does documentary itself comprise, or challenge, larger social and material infrastructures, including funding structures and distribution platforms to new visual technologies?\nDocumentary Publics: The advent of new media platforms and technologies bare, on the one hand, potential for a radical reorganization of social bodies. On the other hand, create fraught contexts through which the social is organized by corporate logic and pseudo-democratic regimes. Framed within these social and medial settings, what forms of deliberation documentary brings to contemporary public and counter-public spheres?\nRace, Gender and Sexuality: How can documentary serve as a means of transgression, a tool for community building, or a platform for organization/organizing in political climate marked by exclusionary tribalisms? How can documentary resurrect non-hegemonic pasts and presents and open up spaces outside of a white, heteronormative and patriarchal matrix?\nDocumentary and the Non-Human: In the epoch of the Anthropocene and in the wake of environmental crisis, how can documentary exceed its \u201cdiscourses of sobriety\u201d that centers the human? How can it give form to the material world, traversing the representational hierarchies between the human and non-human? How do documentaries of nonhuman subjects interact with, reinforce or diverge from human political regimes?\nDocumentary and Operational Media: Considering the proliferation of tools for data analysis, image-based computational techniques and forensic media, how can we re-think documentary\u2019s evidentiary claims at its intersections with fields such as science, medicine, design and law?\nDocumentary Pedagogy: How can we think of documentary pedagogy through a vernacular prism? How have documentary studies responded to the shifting labor conditions of teaching at individual, departmental, and disciplinary levels? How have they been reshaped by videographic practices of criticism and scholarship? How do the evolving methodologies of teaching and writing about documentary speak to the labor it asks of us?\nGuidelines for Submission:\nPanel proposal:Panels will consist of three papers of no more than 20 minutes each and one ten-minute response by the panelists\u2019 chosen respondent. Panel proposals require a title; 300-word description of the panel itself; five keywords that identify the panel\u2019s focus; 250-word abstract for each paper; 100-word biography for each participant and 5 bibliographic entries for the entire panel.\nWorkshop proposal:The emphasis of the workshop is on an open and unstructured exchange of ideas and techniques between all workshop participants. Workshops will consist of five or six opening statements that sum up to forty minutes in total, with the remaining time dedicated to discussion. Workshop proposals require a title; 300-word description of the workshop; five keywords that identify the workshop\u2019s focus; 50-word description of each contribution; 100-word biography for each participant and 5 bibliographic entries for the entire workshop.\nPaper proposal:Individual paper proposals can be submitted through the open call. Accepted papers will be programmed into panels with other individual paper and screening submissions. Individual paper proposals require a title; five keywords that identify the paper\u2019s focus, 300-word abstract; 100-word biography and five bibliographic entries.\nScreening Proposal:Visible Evidence XXVII also invites filmmakers to present their work. To stress the interconnectedness of theory and praxis, screenings and filmmakers\u2019 talk will be integrated into panels through the open call. Screenings will be allotted 20 minutes, ideally for introducing a work in process or for showing clips while introducing the overall project. Screening proposals require a title; 5 keywords that identify the work\u2019s focus; 300-word description of the work; a screener of no more than 20-minute material (as a link) and a 100-word biography.\nEach session will be allotted one hour and forty-five minutes.\nDeadline:All proposals must be submitted here: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ve27All proposals are due by April 12th, 2020.Multiple submissions will not be accepted, except for panel respondents.Applicants will be notified of acceptance by June 15th, 2020.For questions please email visibleevidence2020@gmail.com\n\n https://www.visibleevidence.org/\n\n\n visibleevidence2020@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "AREdu 2020: 3rd International Workshop on Augmented Reality in Education", "location": "Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine", "organization": "Organization: Kryvyi Rih National University", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-13\r\n                        to 2020-05-13", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-22", "description": "Augmented Reality in Education (AREdu) is a peer-reviewed international Computer Science workshop focusing on research advances, applications of virtual and augmented reality in education.\nList of Topics\nVirtualization of learning: principles, technologies, toolsAugmented reality gamificationDesign and implementation of augmented reality learning environmentsAspects of environmental augmented reality security and ethicsAugmented reality in science educationAugmented reality in professional training and retrainingAugmented reality social and technical issues\nSubmission Guidelines\nWe solicit submission of original work,\u00a0not previously published\u00a0or\u00a0submitted for publication\u00a0elsewhere.\nAuthors are invited to submit full (10+ pages) papers via EasyChair submission page at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aredu2020 by April 22, 2020.

Such specialist art periodicals have long been indispensable to the study of art history, a repository from which scholars in the field have looked to retrieve the public meanings of modern art at a particular time and place. By scouring the pages of various reviews, journals and magazines, art historians tacitly acknowledge - and perpetuate - the importance of these illustrated publications in creating the artistic, economic and historic value of modern art and visual culture. Yet the discipline\u2019s typical approaches to periodicals themselves have remained largely archival, extracting individual texts or images with little thought or reference to their original contexts or questions of production, readership, and social, economic or political ties. Only more recently has attention begun to turn to the part that editorial activity, as a creative practice in its own right, played in the development of aesthetic theories and in the evolution of modern artistic currents.\nWe invite contributions from international scholars for a volume dedicated to the history and legacies of The Modern Art Review in Europe (1910-1940). We welcome historical case studies on European modern art periodicals in the early to mid-twentieth century (and their echoes elsewhere), but are particularly interested in investigations that also offer new research in relation to three themes.\nFirstly, we want to explore the multiple meanings that specialist periodicals assume within the history of modern art and consider their complexity as artefacts uniting artistic, social, intellectual and economic activity. More than merely the sum of the writing and reproductions they carried, modern art reviews were\u2013are\u2013often coveted art objects themselves. So by what criteria should we evaluate the various publications of the period, or attempt to judge their influence? By the importance of the texts that appeared in their pages, the renown of their contributors, the quality of their production standards and visual design, their place of publication, the size of their readerships and the geographical extension of their distribution, or by their promotion of certain artists, groups or movements? If we generally acknowledge that art periodicals were instrumental in consecrating a particular face of modern art, a cluster of international \u2018isms,\u2019 how might we determine their significance as aesthetic catalysts or incubators? What did the modern art review mean to artists, not only as the authors and contributors of the ideas and works reproduced in its pages, but also more generally as consumers of those words and images?\nSecondly, we are interested in accounts of reviews, magazines, and journals that confront the interdependence of the art market and the art press. Standing between the production and consumption of artistic goods, in what distinct ways did modern art periodicals shape public taste, transform aesthetic standards and, by extension, create market value? How did the printed page, alongside the gallery window or museum wall, function as a key site of international exposure and valorisation for contested artefacts in the first half of the twentieth century? The ever greater use of photographic reproductions, a prominent feature of the period enabled by advances in printing technology, was due at least in part to the central function that photographs increasingly played in the commercialisation of work and in the exchange of knowledge across transnational networks. To what extent can we observe market forces through editorial content and publishing policies and how did periodicals themselves operate as commercial product(ion)s, subject to their own economic (mis)fortunes? Often dependent upon donated time, texts, photographs, translations, advertisements, and other services, solicited from an array of sympathetic writers, artists, dealers, and collectors, what do the era\u2019s reviews, journals and magazines reveal about the entangled histories of the wider art world?\nLastly, we want to examine some of the different methods emerging in the field of periodical studies. Digitisation, for example, has transformed once limited resources into a vast and readily available corpus, but what benefits do such technologies bring beyond mere accessibility? What fresh insights await, from combining various forms of close and distant reading? Are quantitative methods of analysis, particularly those that look broadly at questions of production, distribution and readership, an important corrective to qualitative studies that have granted a few key publications disproportionate significance in the art historical imagination? If digital tools have more typically lent themselves to unearthing patterns of text, how can they be used to trace, analyse and compare the visual strategies that periodicals employed to present modern art? Conversely, in relying more and more upon digital formats, are we now neglecting the review as a material artefact, have we lost sight of the double-page spread, and the text-image relationships that evolved in this printed, visual space?\nWe welcome proposals for contributions in English of 6,000-8,000 words in length. The abstract should be 1000-1500 words and include a provisional title, your main research question/s and/or arguments, a brief discussion on how they will be elaborated in the article, the methodological approach you intend to take and your primary source materials.

This is germane as the continent of Africa is vast and varied: there are differing narratives that have shaped the trends in the economic development trajectories across African countries. Thus, it is no news that African countries are pursuing a number of development agenda towards achieving economic growth that is inclusive, pro-poor and sustainable, particularly the type that can unleash the potentials of women and booming youthful population. As expected, efforts are being made in a host of African countries to have country-specific Visions (e.g. Vision 2030 of Algeria, Kenya, and South Africa, and so on) that are in tandem with the African Union (AU)\u2019s Agenda 2063 and United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The foregoing is fundamental as most African countries are endowed with enormous resources (material and human). However, available evidence (e.g. from World Development Indicators and African Economic Outlook) shows that many African countries have experienced \u2018economic hardships\u2019 and have performed lower than other developing and emerging countries in the global south. For instance, as at 2018, Africa is regarded as the poorest continent in the world which houses 28 of the world\u2019s poorest countries with the majority having very limited access to basic human necessities.\nObjective\u00a0Some research efforts have been made to elucidate factors responsible for the poor economic development in Africa. Nonetheless, what is yet to be unravelled is the frantic processes of building viable institutions in Africa that will serve as the fulcrum for utilizing and managing Africa\u2019s resources as well as promoting economic growth that is inclusive and sustainable. This is one of the objectives of this edited book. Therefore, it aims a spurring debate amongst scholars, policy-makers, researchers and development agencies thereby provide actionable solutions for Africa\u2019s developmental challenges particularly with respect to sustainable and inclusive economic growth paradigm.\nTarget Audience\u00a0The primary audience for this edited book include: students, academics, policymakers, and development partners.\u00a0The book will be highly relevant for scholars and experts in the field of social sciences, international and development economics as well as resource and energy economics.\nRecommended Topics\u00a0This edited book seeks strategies for building resilient institutional framework for sustainable resource management, sustainable development and inclusive growth. It anticipates extending the frontiers of knowledge by soliciting quality contributions from academics and practitioners that highlight and address the above issues with relevant and actionable recommendations.\u00a0Thus, empirical and theoretical papers that provide new insights into the building of viable institutions for sustainable resource management in Africa\u2019s sustainable development and inclusive development process are welcome. The proposed titles should be tailored within the following sub-themes (but not limited to):\u00a0i. Effective and inclusive institutions (e.g. Civil Societies, developmental advocacy against corruption, promoting ease of doing business, the role of informal and religion institutions);\u00a0ii. Accessible and quality education (promoting educational outcomes; promotion of education innovation; reducing barriers to educational advancement);\u00a0iii. Knowledge economy management (e-Health, e-Agriculture & food security, e-Commerce);\u00a0iv. Financial development in Africa (Financial flows, expansion of both traditional and new forms of financial services e.g. Mobile money; migrant remittances);\u00a0v. Biodiversity, Natural resources and Conservation (protection of natural environment and its inhabitants, aquatic or terrestrial biota; energy provision and access, land access and usage);\u00a0vi. Sustainable Development and Climate Change (the reality of climate change, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, climate change and technology, carbon emissions, infrastructure and industrialisation); and\u00a0vii. Agriculture for Development (agriculture and sustainable food systems; agricultural employment and development; small holder farmers; rural and non-farm economy).\u00a0\nThe editors welcome original articles, including quantitative or qualitative studies, case studies (within country and across countries), or critical reviews, dealing with the sub-themes, which can be built on a multidisciplinary analytical and theoretical framework. The editors would be happy to review the plans for papers in advance of the submission.\nSubmission Procedure\u00a0Interested researchers should submit before\u00a0March 11, 2020, chapter proposal between 950 to 1,950 words clearly explaining the objectives and focus proposed chapter.

It also addresses the opportunities and challenges for scholarly research, industrial practices and education arising from the wide application of digital technologies in cultural production and consumption.\nThe series publishes books that seek to explore how knowledge is (re/)produced and disseminated, as well as how research in humanities is expanded in the digital age. It encourages publication projects that align scholars, artists and industrial practitioners in collaborative research that has international implications. With this as an aim, the book series fills a gap in research that is needed between theory and practice, between Asian and the global, and between production and consumption. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary nature of the book series enhances understanding of the rising Asian digital culture, particularly in entertainment production and consumption, cultural/artistic revisioning, and educational use. For instance, a study of digital animated Chinese paintings will elucidate the reinterpreted Chineseness in artistic representation.\nDetails of the book series are available at: https://www.springer.com/series/15727\n\n https://www.springer.com/series/15727\n\n\n tamkk@hotmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "PANEL FOR SAMLA 92: Scandal and Transgression in Twentieth-Century Transatlantic Vanguardisms (SAMLA 92)", "location": "Jacksonville", "organization": "Organization: SAMLA", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-11-13\r\n                        to 2020-11-15", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-06-01", "description": "This panel explores forms of dissent adopted by twentieth-century transatlantic avant-gardes as a means of challenging traditional genres and social codes. Since the inception of European experimentalism during the first decades of the twentieth century, a series of art movements engaged in radical production that questioned the established state of affairs. From the Cubist adoption of multiple viewpoints, through the Futurist celebration of technology and speed, the Expressionist distortion of form, to the Dadaist sense of provocation and the irrational juxtaposition of images in Surrealism, avant-garde art and literature has set precedents on an international level of exchanges. Thanks to venues that exhibited the work of European expatriates, namely the Armory Show and Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s gallery 291, along with journals such as Camera Work, American Modernists reinvented their own expressive language by rethinking the sense of place. Meanwhile, the Argentinian ultra\u00edstas, the Mexican estridentistas and muralistas as well as the Peruvian group of the journal Amauta, among others, took advantage of European experimental forms and their pre-Columbian past to reflect on the convulsive reality of Latin America. Based on the ideas of scandal, transgression and rebellion, topics might include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u00a0\n\u2014Graphic humor and the grotesque in the avant-garde.\n\u2014The manifesto as a revolutionary form of protest.\n\u2014The inflammatory language of soirees.\n\u2014Transgressive print culture in the age of vanguardism.\n\u2014The rupture of sequence: the snapshot, the montage and the close up.\n\u2014Scandals in Hollywood and the independent film industry.\n\u2014Breaking the boundaries between the visual and the verbal: ekphrasis, photo-poetry and cinepoetry.\n\u2014Subversive ideologies of public images.\n\u2014Consumer society, mass media and the shock of advertising.\n\u00a0\nBy\u00a0June 1st, 2020, please submit a 300-word abstract in English or Spanish along with a brief bio and A/V requirements to Leticia P\u00e9rez Alonso (leticia.p.alonso@jsums.edu), Jackson State University.\n\n leticia.p.alonso@jsums.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "Scandalous Short Stories (SAMLA)", "location": "Jacksonville, FL", "organization": "Organization: SAMLA (South Atlantic Modern Language Association)", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-11-13\r\n                        to 2020-11-15", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-05-31", "description": "SAMLA 92\u00a0will be taking place in Jacksonville, Florida, from November 13th to the 15th.

Thanks to new developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), these new algorithm-based machines are no longer classified only as computational apparatus of a significant logical nature, but they also take part in fields that were previously considered unique to human beings, especially in the creative field. Therefore, the binary distinction between a thinking human-being who learns and creates, and the executive machine that optimizes and improves human activity through embedded automation systems is being undermined.Indeed, artificial intelligence platforms using deep learning and neuronal networks are currently able to autonomously perform many of the tasks that designers used to carry out. Recently, such applications have been developed, and they are capable of generating designs with speed and diversity that human designers cannot accomplish: illustrating original images, designing furniture, drawing architectural plans, creating fonts and suggesting marketing campaigns - to mention just a few examples. AI systems deal with complex problem-solving challenges and with dynamic systems based on feedback loops, and can generate behavioural predictions and link entities from diverse ontological fields. They participate in both planning and production, and touch on the two key components of design: the aesthetic and the operational - form and function. In some cases, they operate as an entity that is external to the phenomena they act upon, while in others, they serve an internal quality that emerges and grows like a natural phenomenon.These developments in AI pose a significant threat to many design professionals who will be replaced by artificial intelligence that will make human labour redundant. However, the integration of AI systems into the design process also provides new opportunities: collaboration with AI systems allows for design on a level of complexity and scale that human cognition cannot encompass. Therefore, based on the recognition of the creative capabilities of the machine, the challenge for designers today is to produce a wide array of embodied intelligences that can be shared by human and machine.\nDespite the great potential inherent in embedding AI apps into the design process, the manner in which they are implemented as well as the logic and infrastructures behind their operation, must be critically examined. The massive financial resources invested in AI in recent years have turned it into a major factor in the shaping of political, civil and private spaces. The principles that outlined AI\u2019s developments in the military, consumer as well as the entertainment industries, which are the engines behind AI, are projected onto the ways in which AI is being used in disciplines with completely different value systems and needs. In addition, the fact that it is not possible to trace how these systems work (the black boxes they create) requires additional attention to the ethical issues involved in the implementation of AI systems in the design process.This conference invites designers, theoreticians, AI developers and the high-tech industry members to explore the different applications used in AI systems in the field of design and to examine the influence of these systems on the design discipline. The purpose of the conference is to allow discussion among the various parties taking part in the changes that are occurring and their possible future implications.Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following questions:\n\u2022 What are the new threats and opportunities facing designers vis-a-vis the use of artificial intelligence?\u2022 What is the role of the designer in the age of AI? In what way is his/her role changing?\u2022 How does the politics behind AI systems influence design products?\u2022 What happens when humans are excluded from design processes that take part autonomously between machines? To what extent can machines be autonomous in the design process?\u2022 Can machines perform creative processes in design?\u2022 Will AI's entry into the design realm redefine the design discipline and will it blur its distinction from other domains?\u2022 How can the use of AI in design be channelled to socially beneficial design?\nThe conference will be held on May 26, 2020, at HIT (Holon Institute of Technology).The proposals - lecture title, abstract of up to 300 words and short CV - should be sent to email: vanessenyaele@hit.ac.il no later than March 20 th, 2020.

The opportunities people are or aren\u2019t given, the decisions they do or don\u2019t make, the qualities they ascribe to themselves and to others \u2013 identity is entangled everywhere. Mention, e.g., a particular sexual orientation, ethnicity, or mental condition and one risks being reduced to a single characteristic. The way we perceive ourselves and others is constantly shaped by language, image, picture, sound, gesture, clothing; the list goes on. Forms of representation can include and exclude, promote and limit self-expression, as well as hinder seeing beyond stereotypes.\nComing to terms with identity appears constantly across cultural, social, and literary discourses. ICON 2020 will provide a discussion forum for all disciplines that address one of the countless aspects of identity and representation.

This approach is also connected to the denunciation of arbitrary definitions in terms of class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality in a post-modern society, as well as to any kind of cultural and identity value expressed, not only but also, by pop-culture. In this context, the relevance given to the post-modern deconstruction of narrations and identities, emphasised by many scholars, has led to a plurality of different readings and a multiplicity of discourses.The concept and the role of the prefix \u201cpost-\u201d has been discussed and developed in a huge variety of diverse scenarios of meanings. The Cultural Studies perspective insists on its positive value as producer of knowledge and meaning in a de-centred panorama, as already asserted by Stuart Hall. On the other hand, the concept of \u201cpop,\u201d introduced by the work of Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and John Fiske, is more concerned with \u201chow meanings, such as those drawn from popular culture offerings, are interpreted and used in everyday life.\u201d The reference is to a culture that comes from the people, but which can, at the same time, influence and intertwine with the so-called \u201chigh-culture.\u201dIn the latter period, indeed also a new perspective on culture has been introduced. The clear-cut division between high and low has started to fade away and a new form of hybrid culture has been born from the interaction of different cultural productions. Intertextuality, multimediality and the influence of the World Wide Web have made this phenomenon possible. The Cultural Studies perspective frees popular culture from ideological constraints by making it a liberating practice in which meaning is not imposed but continually negotiated: \u201cMeaning is constructed \u2013 given produced \u2013 through cultural practices. [\u2026] We map new things in terms of, or by extension or analogy from, things we already know.\u201d At the same time, also the current post-modern, post-national, and post-human society is conforming to those practices in order to create new paradigms and forms of cultural exchange and debate.The conference aims at investigating the evolution of English culture and literature in contemporary society through a Cultural Studies perspective. Through the analysis of literary texts, plays, movies, comics, advertisements and commercials, and the depiction of their connections to the global cultural scenario, a picture of the evolution of the English cultural production of the last decades will be proposed. The conference is open to the following areas of research: literature, philosophy, linguistics, history and anthropology, art, old and new media, sociology.We invite contributions which study, discuss, and promote - among others - the following issues:\u2022 English Literature from the Early-Modern to the new Millennium and its re-writings\u2022 Brex-lit\u2022 Comparative Literatures\u2022 Literature and (post-)culture: post-colonial, post-modern, post-human, post-national\u2022 Popular culture and popular literature and their possible interactions\u2022 Philosophy and mass culture\u2022 Art and Aesthetics in the contemporary era\u2022 Old and new mass-media in contemporary society (cinema, radio, photography, social media, etc.)\u2022 Advertising communication\u2022 Literary and linguistic analysis of movies, TV-series, documentaries, biopics, etc.\u2022 Historical, anthropological, sociological analysis of contemporary society and its constructs theoretical constructs\u2022 Presentation and analysis of artistic installationsThe Conference is addressed to scholars of any institution, as well as to independent researchers, PhD students, and students from MA and BA courses.The time limit for individual presentations is 20 minutes.

There still appears to be ongoing debate regarding the core pathology for gaining managerial expertise in professional roles relative to having suitable leadership skills and managerial knowledge beyond the direct daily work involved in organizations. Professional organizations inherently include varied levels of sensitive human interactions, which further necessitates their management professionals to have leadership styles that are adjustable contingent on a given situation. Relative to this edited book, managerial psychology is being utilized in a way that may subsequently seek to develop a series of scientific theory principles where the focus is to develop managerial axioms that advance contemporary existing knowledge surrounding professional management logic. This book views managerial psychology as shared by various practitioners', academicians' and management and psychology experts' collectively to gain a holistic point of view of their lived experiences and existing knowledge. Because managerial psychology applies in all types of organizations where the behavioral patterns of individuals or groups of people impact the bottom line, the implications of the contribution of various related topics within the book chapters is expected to provide important thought dimensions to a community of scholars and practitioners as well as society in general.\n\n https://www.igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/4412\n\n\n davale1@sbcglobal.net\n\n"}, {"title": "Thesis - International Journals of Social Science and Humanities", "location": "NA", "organization": "Organization: AAB College", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-03-20", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-15", "description": "The International Research\u00a0Journal,\u00a0Thesis, announces the call for manuscripts for the June edition.\nThesis is an international research journal with double-blind peer review, which is published by\u00a0AAB College\u00a0in Prishtina.\nThe journal presents an international forum for empirical, qualitative, critical and interpretative studies, on interdisciplinary research in the Social Sciences\u00a0and Humanities: Economics, Law, Linguistics, Media Studies and Communication, Pedagogical & Educational Research, Political Sciences and International Relations.\nThesis accepts original high-quality articles from various theoretical and methodological approaches and is also open to interpretative and critical articles, as well as monographic review.

In the 1950s, he began drawing and experimenting with collage, and later studied painting in Fernand Leger\u2019s atelier. He published his first poems in 1956 in the magazine Rendez-vous avec le sol, followed by further texts in 1959 in Henri Chopin\u2019s Cinqui\u00e8me saison. However, after these early efforts, French readers would have to wait until 1967 to discover his collages and poetry in the Cahiers de L\u2019Herne, in a special volume also dedicated to William Burroughs and Bob Kaufman.\nIn the meantime, P\u00e9lieu had spent two traumatic years in Algeria after a forced conscription into the army. After returning to Paris in 1959, he met American painter Mary Beach, who would become his lifelong collaborator. Leaving France for San Francisco in 1963, the couple became prolific translators of Beat poets and writers, among them Bob Kaufman, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Alongside their idiosyncratic \u2018translation-adaptations\u2019 for French publishers such as Christian Bourgois, they worked intensively in local scenes on the West Coast and in New York. In 1966, Mary Beach founded her own publishing house, Beach Books, while P\u00e9lieu published a variety of texts in the underground press and in little magazines in Europe and in the USA. Until the late 1970s, P\u00e9lieu dedicated much of his efforts to writing in French, English and franglais, before shifting his focus towards collage, painting, and mail art from the 1980s until the end of his life. Despite this intensive activity spanning a number of decades, recognition of P\u00e9lieu and Beach\u2019s contribution to French and American literary and artistic history has been slow in forthcoming.\nInfluenced by the surrealists, the Dadaists, by Artaud, Michaux, C\u00e9line and even Pr\u00e9vert, P\u00e9lieu plotted a tangential and singular course through the collective adventure of the Beat Generation, practicing cut-up techniques soon after their initiation by William Burroughs and Brion Gysin and persistently exploring various forms of creation in a tireless attempt to reinvent poetry, prose, collage and painting. From the 1960s onward, he worked extensively with countless artists and poets, forming a veritable constellation of collaborators and fellow travelers.\nViscerally archeological, P\u00e9lieu sought to dig through the \u201cdustbins of history and memory,\u201d at the same time as he adopts what French poet Lucien Suel has called a medical and surgical approach to \u201cmercilessly dissect a media-inflected pseudo-reality.\u201d In an interview with writer and critic Bruno Sourdin, P\u00e9lieu defined collage as a kind of \u201cplaster stuck on the movie of our culture and of our History.\u201d In P\u00e9lieu\u2019s work, creation is often a matter of chance and accident and is inscribed in a process of deconstructing logical thought in order to question higher degrees of reality through different literary, pictorial, visual and oral combinations. Operating in a singularly incandescent and scathing mode, P\u00e9lieu uses raw language, jarring juxtapositions and compound images to manipulate and fragment reality to breaking point.\nThis international conference is the first ever dedicated to the work of Claude P\u00e9lieu. It will seek to identify and critically consider the various aspects of the work of this Franco-American creator and passeur\u00a0\u2014\u00a0translation, poems, novels, albums, diary-collages, collages, cut-ups, and mail art (as ongoing notebook on a global scale)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whose oeuvre, as a whole, is fundamentally transatlantic and libertarian.\nThe conference will explore P\u00e9lieu\u2019s short-circuited writing (his surrealist influences, his variations on cut-ups, collage, etc.), his specific processes of creation, and the penetrating glance that he cast upon the modern world through his corrosive oeuvre. It will investigate P\u00e9lieu\u2019s visual works and texts, and those of others to which he contributed, by analyzing their generic (influences, deconstruction, fragmentation), political (pamphlets, manifestos, declarations), and linguistic dimensions, as well was their radical and experimental content and reception.\nThe conference also aims to investigate the various forms of correspondence that P\u00e9lieu maintained with other artists and writers, wherein mail art, translation, and collaborative and networked writing served as a means of instigating a rich and fertile transatlantic dialogue of avant-gardes and countercultures. Special attention could here be paid to P\u00e9lieu\u2019s work with Jeff Nuttall, Carl Weissner, and William Burroughs, as well as to the network that P\u00e9lieu constructed through dozens of poems dedicated to a whole generation of writers, laying the groundwork for a shifting poetic International (Derni\u00e8re Minute \u00c9lectrifi\u00e9e, 1969; Studio R\u00e9alit\u00e9, 1999).\nThe translation-adaptations that Beach and P\u00e9lieu produced of texts by Beat Generation writers also represent a unique form of collaboration and operated as dual means of modifying and disseminating subversively-tinged texts.\nWith this in mind, we will seek in particular to reconsider the decisive role played in P\u00e9lieu\u2019s oeuvre by Mary Beach, a prolific translator, editor, painter and collagist in her own right, and the first woman to experiment with the cut-up (Electric Banana, 1975). P\u00e9lieu\u2019s work is inextricably linked to his collaboration with Beach by virtue of their joint translations of Beat writers as well as her translation of P\u00e9lieu\u2019s own texts, their publishing ventures and their joint visual works created in the 1980s and 1990s. This veritable \u201coeuvre crois\u00e9e\u201d can also allow us to explore gendered and affective dimensions of art making, translation and literary work in the latter half of the 20th century and in countercultural milieus.\nTopics for papers may include, but are not limited to:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cutting up and short-circuits in writing\no\u00a0\u00a0 Infected language: linguistic coding and viral transmission, the dislocated word, the manipulated text, meaning and meaninglessness\no\u00a0\u00a0 Forms of writing: pamphlets, manifestos, script-vite, poem-tracts, reportage-poems, diaries, haiku, koan, sutras, ready-made, collages, comics\no\u00a0\u00a0 Writing-techniques: cut-up, concrete poetry, automatism, filiations and heritage, plural genres and intermediality, genre renewal and mutant avant-gardes\no\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution of P\u00e9lieu\u2019s work in time: key texts, circulation/transfer between writing-collage-translation-editing, autoreferentiality, strategies and modes of auto-representation, autobiography\no\u00a0\u00a0 Links and cross-fertilization between text, image and collage\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Themes in P\u00e9lieu\u2019s work\no\u00a0\u00a0 The broken, mutilated body, the reconstructed body, the diseased body\no\u00a0\u00a0 Transmission, technology, communication, science-fiction, control\no\u00a0\u00a0 The ecological consciousness at work: environmental deterioration, rubbish, recycling, repairing, hybridity\no\u00a0\u00a0 Reality and illusion: ur-reality, surreality, dreaming, spectacle\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intersections, collaborations and resonances\no\u00a0\u00a0 Mary Beach, the writer, the editor, the artist; the cross-fertilizing work of P\u00e9lieu and Beach\no\u00a0\u00a0 Artistic and literary collaborations: Parisian youth; American, beat or countercultural networks\no\u00a0\u00a0 Creating, translating, adapting: P\u00e9lieu as a transatlantic passeur\no\u00a0\u00a0 P\u00e9lieu and visual arts: collages, drawings, concrete and visual poetry, artistic encounters (Raymond Hains, Err\u00f3, Jeff Nuttall), comics, appropriation and misappropriation\no\u00a0\u00a0 The P\u00e9lieu rhizome (Lucien Suel, Michel Bulteau, F.J.

The PSO is mostly used in multicriteria optimization problems. In recent years artificial intelligence techniques are mostly used in portfolio optimization. Optimization is the process of obtaining the best solution when performing certain operations for a given purpose. Before, optimization problems used to be defined by the mathematical functions. Due to the lack of flexibility and disadvantages of such methods, new methods have been developed and inspired by events in nature. Optimization algorithms based on natural events are called Heuristic algorithms. Heuristic algorithms are the algorithms that are inspired by natural phenomena to accomplish any purpose or goal. There is a convergence to the optimum solution in the solution space, but no definite solution can be guaranteed in these algorithms. With the rise of the use of heuristics based methods in problem solving in science, heuristics based methods are widely used in quantitative decision making. As the Portfolio Optimization Problems are considered in this book, it is aimed to give an explanation about the theorical structure of Particle Swarm Optimization and application of PSO for the portfolio optimization problem is set.\nPortfolio optimization is a crucially important problem in modern finance. Portfolio selection is the decision of forming the optimum portfolio from a number of assets under certain expectations and constraints. Solving this kind of problem is quite difficult because of the large amount of complex data and other constraints. The general purpose of portfolio optimization is to discover an efficient frontier that yields the highest expected return on each level of portfolio risk. If a portfolio consists of funds in various kind of assets, then we can say that the portfolio is well diversified. Such portfolios may support a higher return at the lower possible risk. H. Markowitz\u2019s Portfolio Theory for portfolio selection indicates that as you add new assets to an investment portfolio the total risk of that portfolio decreases continuously depending on the correlations of asset returns, but the expected return of the portfolio is a weighted average of the expected returns of each asset (Markowitz, 1952). Put it another way, inverstors may decrease their risk by investing in portfolios rather than in individual assets. In time, some additions are made to the Markowitz model and it was attempted to improve the solution process by different algorithms. The literature indicates that there are so many papers on portfolio optimization problem that studied the Markowitz optimum portfolio using heuristic techniques. These techniques could be more suitable for solving problems in portfolio management than others. However, the studies that deal with this problem by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach are quite rare. In this chapter, a heuristics model of PSO has been explained in detail and presented how to implement Markowitz portfolio optimization using PSO technique.\nTherefore, this book will examine both PSO and Portfolio Optimization theories and implications. And it will be explained to portfolio optimization by using PSO\n\n https://igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/4558\n\n\n burcua@istanbul.edu.tr\n\n"}, {"title": "From Proletariat to Precariat : Representations of Class and Identity in Working-class writing from the 1930s to the present.", "location": "Department of English", "organization": "Organization: The University of Birmingham, England.

In \u201cinterlocking interests\u201d, as Raymond Williams claimed in his classic Culture and Society, \u201ca conclusion about personal feeling became a conclusion about society, and an observation of natural beauty carried a necessary moral reference to the whole and unified life of man\u201d (1958: 48). With the French Revolution at its centre, arguably the decisive historical moment of the era, certain structures of feeling emerged in liberal and revolutionary circles on the European continent. As the breaking-apart of Europe's ancien r\u00e9gimes sparked drastic changes on political and socioeconomic levels, Romantic thinkers sought to employ their texts and activities as contributions to a critical re-evaluation of the status quo. In a Wordsworthian manner, many Romantic poets understood themselves as prophets of the people, whose duty it was to intervene in dominant representational discourses and thereby challenge well-established hegemonic power structures. At the same time, however, Romantic movements must not be understood as having solely gyrated around the intellectual efforts of the elitist few. Fruitfully and mutually intersecting with the individual (and individualised) endeavours of poets, philosophers, scientists, politicians and entrepreneurs, elements of (popular) culture in a more general sense, such as consumer resistance, political cartoons, visual arts, fashion, aesthetics, or cultural rituals like the Grand Tour must also be taken into account to define the emerging formations of the time.\nTo understand the complex interplay of historical momentum, idealist visions of the future as well as Idealist philosophical conceptions that probed into the conditions of existence per se, and courageous activism, key concepts of cultural studies may offer valuable tools for analysis. What we seek to establish with this conference is an understanding of the sociology of Romantic consciousness via cultural materialism as a practice to recreate the zeitgeist of a historical period shaped by numerous forms of intervention. In contrast to approaches to the Romantic Era that take their cue primarily from literary studies, we would like to ask contributors to access the period via the methodologies developed by (British) cultural studies in order to consider Romantic interventions in a possibly new light. We therefore suggest to look at the decades before and after 1800 by way of concepts like: representation, discourse, power, hegemony, articulation, popular culture, identity/subjectivity, class, race, gender, age, production/consumption, place/space, etc.\nWhile we encourage a broad interpretation of the theme of intervention, possible approaches may include the following:\nWe invite proposals for 20-minute papers and also welcome contributions by early career researchers and postgraduate students.\nAbstracts of 250 words and a short biographical info (name, affiliation, current research) should be emailed to romanticinterventions@tu-dortmund.de by March 31, 2020.\n\n https://rominter2021.wixsite.com/tudortmund\n\n\n romanticinterventions@tu-dortmund.de\n\n"}, {"title": "2nd Cultures Conference Current Trends, Issues and Challenges in Diverse Societies (CTICDS 2020)", "location": "Greece", "organization": "Organization: Cultures Conference", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-09-04\r\n                        to 2020-09-05", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-07-17", "description": "Since its foundation in 2017, the Cultures Conference has acted as a learning platform for academic and educational institutions, research centres, institutes, organisations and industry, enabling presentation, discussion and education on key issues, trends and recent developments in the social sciences, humanities, arts, education, business and management fields.

For this reason, film and cultural studies need to reconsider the range and impact of the political and social forces that drive, within global frameworks, the construction and circulation of cultural products. Charles Taylor describes the social imaginary as a way to convey both the subjective realm of social existence and the collective strata of common practices and of perpetually evolving political institutions. The notion of the imaginary has emerged across diverse fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in other disciplines. However, film studies have not convincingly addressed the way in which small cinemas have attempted in the last decades to translate cultural, economic, social complexities on screen. The question is how images of the social, political, ideological were reshaped in the (post)neoliberal age and what effects they have on the cultural production of small nations.\nFor this reason, the conference welcomes papers which investigate political imaginaries in small cinemas and cultures, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the following areas:\n? Perceptions and genealogies of democracy? Representations of global capitalism and local crises? Re-enactments of nationalism? Left and right populisms? Identity reconfiguration across gender and race? The devaluation of labour and post-socialist economic hierarchies? Perspectives on precarity, poverty, and social inequalities? Eco-activism, and challenging big capital-driven climate change? Political subjectivities in globalized capitalism? Political ideologies of aesthetic forms? Colonial, postcolonial, anticolonial, and self-colonial imaginaries? Neoliberal structures in film and cultural markets? Small culture imaginaries and big markets\nPlease send your proposal \u2013 title, abstract (up to 300 words) and short bio \u2013 to\u00a0smallcinemas.bbu@gmail.com\u00a0by the deadline of\u00a0May 15, 2020.

This global turn has been pioneered most notably by Christopher Alan Bayly in his work entitled \u2018Recovering Liberties: Indian Thought in the Age of Liberalism and Empire\u2019. Bayly\u2019s most significant intellectual contribution has been to urge scholars to introduce spaces beyond the European world, such as India, within the realm of global intellectual history, as fertile grounds of ideations. In doing this, he acknowledged the heavy reliance on English materials for his work, thereby enabling a process of canonising a \u2018modern\u2019 and English textual archive for \u2018Indian\u2019 intellectual history. Considering Bayly\u2019s work as our entry point, we intend to problematise this canonisation of key English source texts and English-speaking actors as the exclusive and dominant archive for Indian political thought based on visibility to a \u2018western\u2019 readership.\n\u00a0\nThis intervention is not to prescribe any particular methodology for future intellectual histories of India, neither is it an attempt to overlook alternative methodological approaches that has branched out over the years, since Bayly\u2019s work.\u00a0 Our larger aim in this conference is hinged on two primary concerns. One is of bringing to the fore works of emerging scholars in Indian intellectual history and political thought, framed by both context specificity and vernacular sources. The second important goal is to bring together young scholars working on intellectual traditions, texts, and figures, that are even beyond the purview of the received canon. Therefore, we welcome submissions which will question the ways in which the postcolonial afterlives of the empire, have shaped practices of history writing. By doing so, we hope to incorporate actors and archives from the \u2018margins of history\u2019, as agents of historical change.\n\u00a0\nWe welcome abstracts of not more than 500 words, which may focus on the following themes, but not limited to:\n\u00a0\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resituating the archive in writing histories of South Asia: textual, ethnographic, and oral histories?\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Juxtaposing political thought with political action in the writing of intellectual histories of South Asia.\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ideas and historical actors in context: Positionality informing choice of sources and canon formation\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deconstructing the vernacular: Politics of language, translation, and linguistic communities\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trans-temporality and trans-spatiality in histories of modernity and colonialism.\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reincorporating contested borders and contact zones as fertile grounds of intellection.\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intersectional histories of identity and the politics of history writing: class, caste, race, and gender.\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rethinking analytical categories in historiography: political, social, economic, and cultural.\n\u00a0\nSubmissions should be sent to cantabconference@gmail.com no later than the 20th of March, 2020.

Some people work more often than others, or under more desirable circumstances, or for better pay, but we all do it. You\u2019re probably working right now. If you\u2019re reading a call for papers, you know what work is.\u00a0\nYet like all fundamental categories, work becomes ever more complex as we examine it more closely. As Raymond Williams and Andrea Komlosy have shown, the terms \u201cwork,\u201d \u201clabor,\u201d \u201cjob,\u201d \u201cemployment,\u201d \u201coccupation,\u201d \u201cprofession,\u201d \u201cvocation,\u201d \u201ctask,\u201d \u201ceffort,\u201d \u201cpursuit,\u201d and \u201ccalling\u201d form a dense web of overlapping and contrasting meanings. Language must labor to grasp the connections between cooking a Big Mac and writing a novel, lifting a box in a warehouse and making beds at a hotel, professing and caring for children, hammering and tweeting. But if art is also a kind of work, why is the work of art so rarely directed toward its own conditions of production? While North American literature, television, film, theater, and music have helped to make work intelligible or, conversely, communicated its resistance to meaning, they have also been relatively uninterested in it. Moreover, as Kathi Weeks observes, \u201cwork produces not just economic goods and services but also social and political subjects.\u201d Thus, the analysis of work must also contend with how histories of class struggle, gendered and sexual divisions of labor, racial hierarchies, and citizenship regimes have determined who counts as a worker and qualifies for the rights, protections, and social respect thereof. And yet waged work is only the tip of an enormous iceberg that feminist theorists call \u201csocially reproductive labor\u201d\u2014the gendered, mostly unpaid, and hidden work of caring for, feeding, nursing, and teaching the next generation of workers. Ultimately, the more we meditate on the breadth and depth of work, the less we know what work is or does.\u00a0\nThis conference proposes that the question of work does a great deal of work for the study of North America. The conference is inspired not only by the richness of work as a linguistic, cultural, and historical concept, but also by current conjunctures that are profoundly changing work and its worlds. The bread-winning patriarch has given way to dual-earning households, steady jobs to contingency and \u201cgigs.\u201d Beneath the surface of official unemployment statistics lie decades of stagnant wages, \u201cbullshit jobs,\u201d stress, and alienation. Once a symbol of freedom and opportunity, work has become a symptom of national and international crisis in debates over borders and tariffs, pipelines and policing, \u201cboomers\u201d and \u201cmillennials,\u201d healthcare and automation. Do advances in artificial intelligence spell the end of work as we know it? Are we on the verge of a postwork society? If so, is the crisis of work necessarily dystopian?

Though there are political and ideological differences between these two identities, it may not hamper the strong bondage as there are many common shared values among these nations. History of these nations clues that the bondage and cooperation between them in terms of trade and commerce is not up hold as per the given potential of these nations.It is certain that the importance of their respective counterparts was neglected for decades together. After liberalization of the Indian economy during 1990\u2019s, the then Prime Minister took a bold initiative to link Indian economy with Southeast Asian countries under \u2018Look East\u2019 policy. The subsequent governments at the central government were not strong enough to have good business ties with these nations due to their political inconsistency. The \u2018Look East\u2019 policy was re-energized again under the present government . In recent past, it is evident that there has been a strong and vibrant ties among these nations due to several high level meetings held among these countries to promote business across their international boundaries . Now, \u2018Look East\u2019 policy is practically more vibrant than ever before with the motto \u2018Act East\u2019. This policy facilitates both the countries to emphasize the importance of better regional connectivity for tourism and robust- trade and commerce. It leads to a phenomenal growth in terms of imports and exports to and fro of these countries. At this juncture, the researcher felt that there is a dire need to investigate the trade and economic linkages and its impact among these nations in terms of the present and future volume of the trade and commerce. Further, it is intended to study whether the win-win strategy works for strengthening of these countries in terms of both trade relations and political integrity or not with a view to face the common enemies across their international boundaries.\nObjective\u00a0The primary objective of this book is to throw some light on the trade and economic linkages between India and Southeast Asia. This study covers various aspects in terms of business, trade and commerce in between India and Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia and India together comprises 1.9 billion of population with strong potential for the market. This publication may be benefited to the stakeholders to understand the opportunities and challenges in these countries in terms of new business opportunities. Further, this study may explore various ways and means for economic and trade linkages along with strengthening the cultural ties each other.\nRecommended Topics\u00a01.

The three-day workshop will focus on ambiguity phenomena that are part of the narrative structure of literary texts and can thus be described with the help of narratological frameworks and models. As acts of narration are determined by common organisational principles, the objective of this approach is to show that am-biguity plays a key role in narration and can serve as a useful analytical tool.\nBased on the assumption that literary texts can be conceived as a communicative process between sender and hearer, ambiguity is an integral part of the communicative act of narration. It is still under discussion whether these ambiguity phenomena are taken as \u2018vices\u2019 (Grice, Chomsky) or \u2018virtues\u2019 (Jakobson, Piantadosi). Yet, they can be modelled in a matrix of production and perception that regards ambiguity either as strategic (PS+/RS+) or non-strategic (PS-/RS-). This framework contrib-utes to answer the question how exactly ambiguity phenomena play a role in both producing and perceiving texts and how they affect the interpretation by the reader.\nOur starting point: Narratology in general is more concerned with the question How is narrated? instead of asking What is narrated? and thus investigates narrative structures such as time, space, narration, perspective or characters. Our questions: How does ambiguity relate to each of these structural categories? Which categories are more prone to ambiguity than others? How does speaker-hearer interaction work in narrative texts in which ambiguity phenomena feature promi-nently?\nWe welcome papers that address one of these questions in a 20-minute talk. Each talk will be followed by 20 minutes of discussion. To submit a proposal, please send an abstract of max. 300 words to ambigui-taet@graduiertenkolleg.uni-tuebingen.de by May 15, 2020.

Klemm,\u00a0King Mongkut\u2019s Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang, Thailand\nOBJECTIVESoutheast Asians consume various traditional and new media content, which makes the region a big market for content distributors. In particular, drama series produced in China, Japan, Korea, India, and the United States have aired in Southeast Asian countries and were presented either through dubbed or subbed content. Music and fashion sense inspired by popular music groups in East Asia have also developed and gained a large fan following in the region.\nThis issue collates papers that analyze the various manifestations of glocalization in media content exhibited in Southeast Asia. Dreisbach (2018) defined glocalization as \u201ca wordplay of the terms global and local that means the accommodation of foreign cultural sensibilities by local actors.\u201d Robertson (2000) conceptualized glocalization as the accommodation and/or contextualization of foreign ideas which results in cultural diversity.

This conference invites scholars working in the various humanities to imagine what our diverse disciplines have to contribute to contemporary critical thinking about labor. ?Economics and the social sciences have been detailing the social and material effects of a rapidly changing set of economic systems in the Western world, which in the course of less than 200 years has transitioned from plantation-colony to industrial-nationalism to post-industrial and globalized at a breakneck pace. With this rapid transition has come a shifting conception of wha tlabor is, and how we talk about and conceive of labor, with many historical groups, identities and economic classes excluded from the larger narrative. With the advent of 24-hour convenience stores, drive-thru fast food, subscription groceries, and Amazon Prime, the rise of a culture that values instant gratification above all often fails to allow us to stop and think critically about the impact ofthese practices on other aspects of life. Consequently, the way we think about labor has become increasingly fraught. Our conference encourages prospective applicants to look critically at labor practices--both historical and modern--and the ways they shape our constructions of society, the body, and the self. What do the humanities have to contribute to this economic and social discussion? How can the intersectionality of the various fields of the humanities serve to enhanceour understandings of and relationships to work and labor? How does this complicate the way we understand labor in today\u2019s global climate? ?How does the study of literature open new terrain for conceptualizing labor?This conference is searching for diverse voices in all branches of the humanities who have something to say about labor. We welcome work from scholars working on their undergraduate or graduate degrees, as well as the work of early-career independent scholars. Applicants are encouraged to consider the tensions between labor as it is constructed, represented,and understood through discourse and the actual performance of labor. Possible conference topicsare not limited to, but may include:\n-What are the grand narratives of labor, and how have they changed over time?\n-?How have transformations of labor in the neoliberal era impacted the novel form?\n-How does rethinking social reproduction as labor transform the historian's approach to the archive?\n-From an economic standpoint, how do different traditions of labor shape society?\n-The social construction of labor\n-How are economic production and consumption related to cultural production and consumption?\n-How do material realities intersect with race, gender, and sexuality?\n-What do the tensions between philosophical constructions of human worth and purpose and therealities of human life have to say about labor?\n-How does the transformation of art between the Renaissance period and the Modern period reflectour cultural attitudes toward art and labor?\n-What is the visibility of unpaid and forced labor in broader historical and current culturalnarratives? (slavery, prison labor, domestic labor)\n-Labor as a form of systemic oppression (slavery)-How has the criminalization of certain forms of work affected cultural narratives?-Sex work as labor, the criminalization of s-work, FOSTA/SESTA\n-What voices are/have been excluded from both current and historical conversations about work?\n-Disability politics in labor\n-Queering labour, the trans body and labor\n-Femininity and labor, especially in relation to child-bearing and motherhood/parenthood-What effects has automation had on cultural narratives about work?\n-Intersectionality of labor as it relates to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.\n-Agrarian labor practices, urban labor practices, manual labour, unions, organized labor\nWe encourage participants to think about ways in which applying interdisciplinary approaches to thestudy of labor problematizes and opens up new fields for critical inquiry. ?Submissions open tograduates, undergraduates and independent scholars.

Forged on the ruins of the former empires, nations were subsequently dismantled by wars, and (eventually) built again. Individuals were born in one country, lived their lives in another, and died in yet another one, sometimes even without ever leaving their hometown. Far more impressive is the phenomenon of cross border migration generated by all these hazards and misfortunes of the previous century. Individuals flew to escape political repression, ethnic resentment, race hatred, and/or confession antagonisms. Others sought adventure, the illusions of a better society and a nondiscriminatory world, and were driven by the idea of a decisive and inevitable revolution. Existences became thus intricate and intertwined with the different political, cultural, and social milieus it interacted with. Moreover, the various, cross-border, and transnational contexts in which the biographies evolved altered and influenced existences, while also being subject to permanent (re)constructions and manipulation. All these evolutions transformed the individual\u2019s identity and molded their inner self towards internationalization, adjusting their existence to a life that transcended citizenship, race, ethnicity, confession, and borders.\nThis call for paper seeks methodological and case-study perspectives on XX century biographies, interpreted within a framework of cross-national/transnational connections, surpassing the nation-centered apprehension of history. The contributions should acknowledge and interpret destinies and existences as subjected to transnational spaces and structures, while considering actors as non-state (or multi-state) entities. Moreover, we seek contributions that surpass the \u201ccenter-periphery\u201d paradigm, focusing on a \u201chorizontal\u201d approach, while also reversing the spotlight from diplomatic and political history towards the social and cultural dimension of it.\nEditors welcome contributions from different fields of research: history, political science, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology, gender studies or any other related areas of interest.\nTopics may address (but are not limited to) the following aspects:\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 methodological issues of reconstructing biographies\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 politicization of ordinary lives due to historical contexts\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 biographies at the intersection of micro and macro-history\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 border shifting and the question of citizenship\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gendered subjectivity\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 reconstruction and reinterpretations of the self within different ideological paradigms\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comintern and formal/informal networks it had generated\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 destinies of professional revolutionaries\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurocommunism and transnationalism\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scientific and cultural exchanges across the Iron Curtain\n\u00a0\nContributors are kindly asked to write abstracts (English, French or German) that do not exceed 500 words.\nDeadline: 2nd of May 2020.\nYou may submit your proposals at:\nhce11@iiccmer.ro, dalia.bathory@iiccmer.ro, stefan.bosomitu@gmail.com, stefan.bosomitu@iiccmer.ro\nSelected authors will be notified by the 10th of May 2020.\nThe deadline for the final draft of the paper is the 1st of September 2020.\nThe academic journal History of Communism in Europe is edited by The Institute for the Investigation of the Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile.

Presentation content can be at a novice, intermediate or advanced level.\nProposal Guidelines\nThis year the PyData London Conference will be doing double blind reviews, where reviewers will select the talks solely based on the quality of the proposals submitted. Please DO NOT include any identifying information in your proposal.\u00a0That is, do not include links to previous talks, slides, repo, etc. Again, talk selection decisions will be made solely on the proposal itself and nothing else- so be sure to give some thought into writing your proposal! Here are some general guidelines and tips for you.\nPlease note that your proposal will not be reviewed by us until after the Call For Proposals (CFP) closing date, and that you can change your proposal as much as you want prior to the closing date. If there is anything unclear in your proposal, we will be reaching out with questions the two weeks after the CFP closes. Be sure to check your email late Feb/early March to respond to those questions!\nStructure\nA talk proposal is a short description of a talk that is aiming to convince someone to part with 30 minutes of their time, in order to learn about something. A good proposal should disclose:\nThere are two parts to a proposal:\nWhile there is no strict template for this, you should make sure that the audience can understand why your talk is relevant for them.\nTutorials\nThese are 90 minutes hands-on sessions where you have the opportunity to lead a classroom so attendees can learn about a new skill/library/technology in a self-contained way, and have said materials available to students before-hand so they can follow suit. Guidelines for the tutorial proposal are the same as above, but the description should make clear what are the requirements for the class and how the materials are going to be distributed (e.g. github repo, links, etc).\n\n https://pydata.org/london2020/\n\n\n london@pydata.org\n\n"}, {"title": "Hate Speech in Asia: Challenges and Solutions", "location": "Bangkok, Thailand", "organization": "Organization: Asia Centre Bangkok", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-07-08\r\n                        to 2020-07-10", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-02-29", "description": "Across Asia hate speech based on fake news has led to an increase of violent incidents as disinformation divides communities during periods of political and communal tensions. With rising internet penetration and use of mobile devices, abusive and threatening remarks both in speech and writing are going viral over social media. Often such content expresses intense prejudice against individuals or particular groups, on the basis of disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, political ideology, race, religion or sexual orientation which can rise up to a frenzy leading to violent outcomes. Governments have enacted laws to preserve public order as well as to protect human dignity. They have also sponsored and assembled inter-faith dialogues and embarked on social cohesion efforts. Other stakeholders such the UN, international organisations, civil society and faith-based groups are also doing their part to combat hate speech. In the search for solutions to these challenges, there is also a need for an evidence-based discussion to critically examine the phenomenon of hate speech and its impact on democracy, the rule of law and human rights.\u00a0 This conference seeks to address the issue of hate speech from an evidence-based and a solution grounded approach while upholding freedom of expression.\n\n https://asiacentre.org/event/hate-speech-in-asia-challenges-and-solutions/\n\n\n research@asiacentre.org\n\n"}, {"title": " International Conference: Challenges and Solutions in Education, Teaching and Learning (International Conference)", "location": "London, UK", "organization": "Organization: London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-09-26\r\n                        to 2020-09-26", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-05-15", "description": "\u201cChallenges and Solutions in\u00a0Education, Teaching and Learning\u201dInternational Conference26 September 2020 \u2013\u00a0London, UKorganised by London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research\nAttempting to answer the what-is-worth-knowing questions, the conference will explore major themes concerning the current situation in education, teaching and learning.

This will be conducted according to three research areas:\nThe anachronismNarratives and discourseThe temporality of trauma and subjectivityThe aim of this conference is to develop a multidisciplinary reflection on the complex relationship between narrative and temporality. The central topics concern the multiple and articulated ways in which narrative practices and forms of temporality dynamically interact, by developing a multifaceted space of concepts, theories, practices and knowledge, in a dynamics of cross-disciplinary thinking.\nThe conference will expand on strategies and constructions, forms and practices concerning time, temporality, periodizations and chronologies, trauma and memory narratives, and research on subjectivity. These topics are strongly connected with the work of narrative, and are critically evaluated in a range of textual productions from novels to short stories, from audiovisual narratives to linguistic constructions of different natures. The act and practices of telling stories, of creating narrative structures, of elaborating narrative practices, and the ruptures of narratives, will be approached.\nWe can think of the following questions in relation to the topic: how has time been represented, coded, understood by humans? In which ways is temporality a dimension of our experience as human subjects? How do human beings apply meaning to temporality? How is trauma experience related to such temporal/subjective narratives?\nProposals are welcome, but not limited to, the following research topics:\nNarrative studiesTextualityStudies on time and temporalityThe anachronism: theories and methodologiesMemory studiesTrauma studies (in literature, cinema, other forms of expression)Representation: telling and staging of traumas, bereavements, critical moments in temporal developmentAudiovisual studies (cinema, video, television) concerning experience and subjectivityPsychoanalysis and time, psychoanalysis and trauma\nProposals up to 250 words should be sent by\u00a025\u00a0March\u00a02020\u00a0to:\u00a0spatiality.temporality@lcir.co.uk.\nDownload\u00a0paper proposal form.\nRegistration fee \u2013 120 GBP\nProvisional\u00a0conference venue: Robinson College, Grange Road, Cambridge CB3 9AN\n\n http://spatiality.temporality.lcir.co.uk/cambridge-conference/?fbclid=IwAR030sniuAhkW7QwrqVYoWvha0BCamP-y1etiLoDhb202J3ITnbZI10CIZo\n\n\n spatiality.temporality@lcir.co.uk\n\n"}, {"title": "RACISM, NATIONALISM AND XENOPHOBIA - 3rd International Interdisciplinary Conference  (Conference)", "location": "Gdansk", "organization": "Organization: InMind Support", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-06-08\r\n                        to 2020-06-09", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-26", "description": "\u00a0CFP:\nIt is widely known that ideologies of racism, nationalism, and xenophobia are dangerous and spread all over the world.

Far from forming a school or a homogenous theoretical field, cognitive approaches to literature appeared in the 1980s and consist of bringing together literary interpretation and the paradigm that has been dominating science since the late 1950s. As Terence Cave puts it, although they do not hold a central place in literary studies, the methodologies that use cognitive science in literary interpretation are becoming more and more numerous\u00a0[2]. Likewise, Lisa Zunshine noticed the exponential growth of the number of researchers interested in this field, stating that in 1999, when the Modern Language Association\u00a0created its official discussion group on this topic, the group consisted of 250 members and by 2009, it already had 700 members, and in 2013, 2000\u00a0[3]. That said, in 2019, the interest in the study of literature through a cognitive prism has still not really left the Anglo-Saxon space where it emerged\u00a0[4], despite a number of significant contributions that hail from other spaces, particularly from France and Italy\u00a0[5], but also from Norway\u00a0[6], Hungary\u00a0[7], and Romania\u00a0[8]. Cognitive literary studies is nowadays an eclectic, dynamic and promising field, which\u00a0\u2013 despite the scepticism of those who do not share our interest for the study of the link between literature on the one hand, and the human mind and brain on the other \u2013 enriches our understanding of fiction, as well as of ourselves. In the end, stories reveal, as Mary-Laure Ryan reminds us, \u201cthe functioning of the human mind in one of its most fundamental, universal, and complex manifestations\u201d\u00a0[9].\nOn the one hand, cognitive literary studies resulted in the renewal of disciplines such as narratology\u00a0[10] and poetics\u00a0[11]. On the other hand, they provided new tools for the analysis of fiction. For instance, Monika Fludernik theorised the notion of \u201cexperientiality\u201d\u00a0[12], later taken up by Marco Caracciolo\u00a0[13]. Guillemette Bolens examined the \u201ckinaesthetic styles\u201d and the literary depiction of embodied cognition\u00a0[14]. Suzanne Keen suggested a typology of narrative empathy\u00a0[15]. Sylvie Freyermuth, amongst others, turned to the theory of mind as a tool of literary interpretation\u00a0[16], and researchers such as Alexandre Gefen and Emmanuel Bouju studied the status of emotions in literature\u00a0[17]. Classical as well as contemporary authors have been productively (re)read through this innovative theoretical framework\u00a0\u2013 see, for example, Mary Crane\u2019s work on Shakespeare\u00a0[18]. In the same vein, Emily Troscianko identified and theorised the aesthetics of cognitive realism\u00a0[19], whilst Terence Cave developed a cognitive criticism\u00a0[20]. Psychologists and neuroscientists such as Keith Oatley\u00a0[21], Melanie Green, Timothy C. Brock\u00a0[22], and Anna Abraham\u00a0[23] investigated the mental and neural mechanisms at work during the interaction between fiction and the human mind and brain. Cognitive literary studies have also renewed the way in which we conceptualise fiction, through the prism of the theory of mind (Lisa Zunshine\u00a0[24]) or through that of neurophenomenology (Paul Armstrong\u00a0[25]). The status of the reader and the author are also being redefined\u00a0[26], after several decades during which the author was excluded from literary analysis, while the reader was reduced to a mere abstract, operational, and disembodied notion (\u201cimplied reader\u201d, \u201cabstrakter Leser\u201d).\nConsidering the eclecticism that defines cognitive literary studies as beneficial, we invite literary critics as well as researchers from all branches of cognitive science interested in this field to reflect together on the status, the theories, the methodologies and the challenges that cognitive literary studies are currently facing. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 literary fiction in the light of the enactive paradigm, the 4E (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended) cognition, and the interoceptive turn\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cognitive realism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the embodied reader and the embodied author\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 narrative empathy\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fiction and emotions\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the literary depiction of human, animal and machine cognition\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 critics and limits of cognitive approaches to literature\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the status of cognitive literary studies in contemporary research\n\u00a0\nAbstracts of no more than 300 words, either in English or in French, as well as a bio-bibliographic notice (100-150 words), should be sent to diana.mistreanu@lsrs.lu by March 1, 2020.

Contemporary consumers collect not only secondhand vinyl records, but also cassettes, VHS tapes, reel-to-reels, film cameras, slides, and prints; they purchase and use refurbished or newly produced record players, cassette decks, Polaroid cameras, and Super 8s. Meanwhile, contemporary artists and musicians engage once-obsolete formats and techniques in their practice, releasing albums on cassette, for instance, or using 16mm film.\nWhy are these media formats and technologies experiencing such a resurgence? How do consumers and artists creatively engage them? And what do these contemporary engagements mean? This interdisciplinary symposium invites theoretically informed proposals for work drawing on ethnographic, historical, and practice-led approaches to these questions. Participants may address (but are not limited to) the following themes:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contemporary cultures of collecting and practices of production\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The diverse influences of race, gender, age, and/or social class\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The aesthetics, politics, and social significance of these technologies\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analog-digital binary in cultural thought and practice\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Capitalism and the political ecology of formerly obsolescent technologies\n\u00a0\nSubmissions\nWe invite proposals for individual papers, film screenings, lecture-demonstrations, and roundtables on the multifaceted afterlives of analog media and technology. Abstracts (250 words) should also include title of the presentation, presenter name(s) and affiliation(s), email address contact, and a short biography (100 words).\nPlease send your proposal as a Word attachment to analog.afterlives@gmail.com; you can address any preliminary queries to Dr Nicholas Tochka (nicholas.tochka@unimelb.edu.au).

Toklas, Gertrude Stein recounts a remarkable interaction with her close friend Pablo Picasso. As they are headed out the door, their conversation slipping between paintings, French lessons, and tea with Picasso\u2019s wife Fernande, Stein pauses:\n\"Oh I forgot to give you these, said Gertrude Stein handing Picasso a package of newspapers, they will console you. He opened them up, they were the Sunday supplement of american papers, they were the Katzenjammer kids. Oh oui, Oh oui, he said, his face full of satisfaction, merci thanks Gertrude, and we left.\"\nThese comments, while fleeting, bear witness to the myriad connections between the world of avant-garde art and literature and the burgeoning medium of newspaper comics, challenging the tired distinctions between \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d aesthetic forms. Indeed, Picasso and Stein were hardly the only modernist figures fascinated by the possibilities (and pleasures) of this strangely charming new mode of pictographic storytelling: T. S. Eliot and e. e. cummings adored George Herriman\u2019s Krazy Kat (and the latter famously wrote the introduction for the first selected edition of Krazy comics, published just two years after Herriman\u2019s death); the poet Dorothy Parker wrote astutely about the cultural value of comics in her columns for The New Yorker; even James Joyce, on entering a local bookshop, would often skip the literary reviews and head straight for the comics.\u00a0\nThe connections between Picasso and Rudolph Dirks, Eliot and Herriman, Parker and Frank King are more than just anecdotal. As Jared Gardner has written, \u201cit is hard not to see intimate connections between the formal experiments with the novel by Joyce or Faulkner and the fragmentary, looping narratives\u201d that characterize so much comics art. Indeed, popular comics and avant-garde modernism had a lot to teach each other: the crowded, bizarre pages of Frank King\u2019s comics (especially Crazy Quilt) are deeply inspired by cubism; Marcel Duchamp\u2019s experiments depicting movement, evident in his famous Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, owe much to the motion lines of contemporary newspaper comics (to say nothing of the signature \u201cR. Mutt,\u201d which adorns his Fountain and refers in part to the popular Mutt and Jeff comic strip).\u00a0\nScholars have not overlooked the important relationship between literary modernism and long-form graphic narrative. Critics such as Isaac Cates, Daniel Worden, Katherine Roeder, David Ball, Jackson Ayers, and Janine Utell, to name just a few, have offered compelling contributions to our understanding of how contemporary comics has carried on the legacy of high modernism. From Alison Bechdel\u2019s frequent allusions to modernist writers to Chris Ware\u2019s careful exploration of discursive consciousness, comics art is woven into the fabric of modernist aesthetic praxis.\nWhile few scholars working today would question the connections between avant-garde modernism and comics art, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of their shared cultural, political, and material histories. How does comics art\u2014early newspaper comics, superhero comics, long-form auteurist comics\u2014refine our definitions of modernism? What formal characteristics of comics emerge, shift, or ebb when we position the history of the form alongside the avant-garde? What sorts of shared material and technological histories governed the mechanical modes of reproduction common to comics art, little magazines, and even finely printed editions of modernist novels? How have political formations\u2014race, gender, class, sexuality, nationality\u2014shaped the production, circulation, and reception of both comics and modernism? How do audience, readership, and accessibility converge or diverge to cultivate an aesthetics of taste?\nThis volume, which has attracted the interest of a major university press, seeks to address these and other questions, and contribute to scholarship in both modernist studies and comics studies. The collection is not just about taking comics seriously as a mode of aesthetic expression; it\u2019s about coming to understand the ways in which comics has always been taken seriously, and how comics art forms a constituent part of our contemporary understanding of modernism. Proposals on any topic relevant to disentangling the complex shared history of literary and visual modernism and comics are welcome.

L. McCallum (Michigan State University)\nCancelled: Tiffany King (Georgia State University)\nClaims about marginality are increasingly being made in order to explain and justify a wide variety of actions in North American culture and politics, economics and the arts. As a result, the concepts of the margins and marginalization seem to have renewed urgency. The center-margins binary is far from new, having been crucial to poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and intersectional criticisms of the 1980s and 90s. Since then, however, numerous theoretical interventions have attempted to redirect critical discourse away from this dichotomy. It is in this light that the 13th annual Graduate Conference of North American Studies at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin seeks to investigate the current relevance and contemporary debates surrounding the margins and marginality across numerous fields of research.\nMarginality is perhaps best understood here as a transdisciplinary concept whose actual meaning is radically contingent upon context: Aesthetic marginality and the avant-garde are commonly seen as productive to creativity, whereas in social contexts, marginality is often detrimental and caused by discriminatory practices. Social justice movements like #MeToo or #BlackLivesMatter make claims for marginality and mutuality, but so do actors of the political (far-)right, who argue that it is they who are being victimized by mainstream media and a culture of political correctness. These claims can of course be contested, but that makes other questions all the more pertinent: Is there a strategic value in pronouncing oneself marginal or marginalized? What does it mean to feel marginalized? What kind of agency is possible in the margins, however conceptualized?\nThe Graduate School invites abstracts for individual 20-minute presentations from researchers of all disciplines of American Studies including cultural studies, economics, history, literature, political science, sociology, and related fields of research.

Cole\u2019s comment on the relationship between photography and violence was made by a practitioner of photography. Morrison\u2019s observation on the relationship between language and violence was brought to our attention by a novelist. In each case, the writer focusses on the material and social issues intrinsic to the use of a specific medium of expression. Refusing to look past the material and social conditions of expression, these two interventions allow us to imagine and to explore new, subversive paths of creation and criticism. It not a coincidence that Cole\u2019s first essay on photography is entirely informed by the concept of the blind spot. And it is not a coincidence that Morrison\u2019s speech, too, invokes a conjunction of blindness and knowledge: \u201cOnce upon a time there was an old woman. Blind. Wise.\u201d In each case, the creation of images and thoughts stems from a joyous failure to comply and an imaginative refusal to go along. The work of art conjured in this process is one of generative interruption. In his study of the black radical tradition in poetry and music, In the Break, furthermore, Fred Moten has written of the interruptive power of such a poetics: \u201cThe history of blackness is testament to the fact that objects can and do resist. Blackness \u2014 the extended movement of a specific upheaval, an ongoing irruption that anarranges every line \u2014 is a strain that pressures the assumption of the equivalence of personhood and subjectivity.\u201d Moten\u2019s notion of \u201canarrangment\u201d speaks here to the simultaneously disruptive and productive potential of paying attention to the social and material conditions of aesthetic forms and the radical potentiality inside aesthetic responses to such conditions.\n\u00a0\nBoth film and philosophy have participated and still participate in sustaining systemic oppression. This has taken both overt and covert forms of violence and exclusion \u2014 each perpetuating the policing of what counts as compelling questions to ask, what forms of knowledge matter, who is heard and seen, and under what conditions and where a subject can appear. And yet, if film has the ability to do philosophy, to question itself and its limitations and possibilities, and to pose new problems for philosophy, then perhaps film also has the potential to challenge its own imperial and oppressive habits and conditions as well. In a hegemonic context, the interruption of dominant ways of thinking and showing allows for alternative modes of knowledge and imagination, subjectivity and being, to emerge. Christina Sharpe, in her recent study In the Wake, makes a compelling case for what she calls the analytic of \u201cwake work,\u201d a theory and a praxis that turns on the imagination\u2019s ability to imagine otherwise with and against rupture. Alongside Cole\u2019s and Morrison\u2019s important points, in Moten\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s work we discern a certain interruptive gesture that refuses the work of normative canons and formations of knowledge, an aesthetics and politics of interruption that can both expose the ideological underpinnings and assumptions of institutional conjunctions like film and philosophy and contribute to new possibilities and spaces for (re)arranging subjectivities, communities, and the very legacies and practices of such institutions themselves.\n\u00a0\nFor its 5th edition, the Spiral Film and Philosophy conference wants to bring the potential of interruption to the forefront. It proposes to do so at the confluence of three areas: the epistemological, the political, and the aesthetic. What happens to ideas and forms when the imagination stumbles? What kinds of resistance emerge when traditional representation breaks down? Which modes of belonging do we share when the spectacle is suddenly interrupted? What happens when the dynamics of domination \u2014 in aesthetic, formal, durational, spatial, psychological, historical, etc. terms \u2014 are rendered inoperative? In the spirit of these questions, we challenge all participants to go above and beyond the common idea according to which it is \u201ceasier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism.\u201d We contend that cinema and moving images have value, even and especially when they do not work as intended, as programmed, or as expected; when they fail, stutter or stammer; when they confuse their objects, miss their targets, or (suddenly or gradually) fall apart. As such, this call for papers is open to but also extends beyond the experience of cinematic rupture.

Imagination is associated with creativity and the ability to invent visions, ideas, images, societies and sensations in ways that transcend reason and reach beyond reality. It is a force that ongoingly wrestles with the constitution of reality and is credited for having shaped the world as we know it through the cumulative work of writers, artists and philosophers.\nImagination, hence, produces, creates a higher reality that becomes the new reality. It is a synthesizing force that oscillates between the fantastic and the real, the conscious and the unconscious, words and images, or, in Bachelard\u2019s words, the earth and the wind.\nThis symposium aims at investigating ideas and imagined systems that have shaped humanity and new imagined forms that are changing the world.

What aesthetic modes are associated with collection cultures, and what might they tell us about topics like American consumerism, democracy, inequality, and more? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor consideration, please send an abstract of no more than 300 words and a brief CV to: najung@uwm.edu by April 5th, 2020.

C\u2019est une Bourse o\u00f9 les doctrines, les id\u00e9es, les d\u00e9couvertes, les dogmes les plus divers, sont mobilis\u00e9s, sont cot\u00e9s, montent, descendent, sont l\u2019objet des critiques les plus impitoyables et des engouements les plus aveugles. Bient\u00f4t les apports les plus lointains arrivent abondamment sur ce march\u00e9. D\u2019une part, les terres nouvelles de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique, de l\u2019Oc\u00e9anie et de l\u2019Afrique, les antiques empires de l\u2019Extr\u00eame-Orient envoient \u00e0 l\u2019Europe leurs mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res pour les soumettre \u00e0 ces transformations \u00e9tonnantes qu\u2019elle seule sait accomplir. D\u2019autre part, les connaissances, les philosophies, les religions de l\u2019ancienne Asie viennent alimenter les esprits toujours en \u00e9veil, que l\u2019Europe produit \u00e0 chaque g\u00e9n\u00e9ration ; et cette machine puissante transforme les conceptions plus ou moins \u00e9tranges de l\u2019Orient, en \u00e9prouve la profondeur, en retire les \u00e9l\u00e9ments utilisables.Notre Europe, qui commence par un march\u00e9 m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en, devient ainsi une vaste usine ; usine au sens propre, machine \u00e0 transformations, mais encore usine intellectuelle incomparable. Cette usine intellectuelle re\u00e7oit de toutes parts toutes les choses de l\u2019esprit ; elle les distribue \u00e0 ses innombrables organes. Les uns saisissent tout ce qui est nouveaut\u00e9 avec espoir, avec avidit\u00e9, en exag\u00e8rent la valeur ; les autres r\u00e9sistent, opposent \u00e0 l\u2019invasion des nouveaut\u00e9s l\u2019\u00e9clat et la solidit\u00e9 des richesses d\u00e9j\u00e0 constitu\u00e9es. Entre l\u2019acquisition et la conservation, un \u00e9quilibre mobile doit se r\u00e9tablir sans cesse, mais un sens critique toujours plus actif attaque l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre tendance, exerce sans piti\u00e9 les id\u00e9es en possession et en faveur ; \u00e9prouve et discute sans piti\u00e9 les tendances de cette r\u00e9gulation toujours obtenue. \u201d\nPaul Val\u00e9ry, \u201cNote (ou L\u2019Europ\u00e9en)\u201d (1924)\nBrexit has just happened and its consequences are not yet fully comprehended. Would the outcome be a return to a status quo ante the Brentry of 1 January 1973 in British-EU relations? Would Britain become a sort of bigger Norway tightly connected to the EU, but yet not fully a member of the united organization? Would Britain really continue to exist as such? Would Scotland, not to mention other territories, emulate London and decide on their own Brexit, this time from the United Kingdom, in order to rejoin the EU? Would actually Brexit become a pathway for other skeptical EU nations? Would Brexit rocket exclusive forms of nationalisms? Wouldthe whole of united Europe collapse, on the long run, as a result of Brexit as the League of Nations had become toothless after the US Senate had vetoed the Pact of League of Nations? But what effect is going to have Brexit on Scandinavian countries which historically have been closely connected to Britain? How is it reflected in Scandinavian intellectual milieus, in mass-media, in public discourses? What about the Baltic states which received a strong support from Britain in key moments of their history, for instance when Royal Navy came at the rescue of Estonian and Latvian independence following World War I or in the process of re-enactment of Baltic sovereignty after the collapse of the Soviet Union? Moreover, Britain was a key market for Baltic products both during the interwar period and after 1990/1991. How are their elites and public opinions reflecting on Brexit? What can they do in order to continue their strong bonds in foreign and security policy, including Eastern neighborhood, and close commercial ties? What would be the status of their co-citizens emigrated to Britain? These are but a few questions which this conference aims at answering both from a political science and international relations perspective and from a cultural, historical, educational, social and economic perspective.When approaching the rethinking of Europe we shouldn\u2019t eschew the fact that Europe, including Baltic and Nordic Europe, has changed quite dramatically in the past hundreds of years, and this conference aims at digging ideationally in these layers of history, even going further to the time when the Vikings recreated the European networks as a result of their trade and pillage expeditions. The Hansa, the Kalmar Union, the Swedish realm (some continue to this day calling it empire), the Russian Empire, Norway\u2019s independence in 1905, the First World War, the independence of Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia a hundred years ago, the League of Nations, the Second World War and the Soviet occupational regimes forced upon in the Baltic states, the Cold War and the Iron Curtain, and finally the freedom regained by the Baltic nations and the adhering by Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania to the EU, and of the latter three countries to NATO had a tremendous impact on the region and falls within the aims of this conference. How was this region recreated mentally, how was it recomposed on the portative of decision makers, writers, intellectuals, musicians, painters, architects, film makers, journalists, diplomats, and how much of their thoughts found reflections in what actually happened in the region? Cultural institutions and networks, language and its social content, various cultural currents and political ideologies and doctrines would be closely investigated and discussed in the keynote speeches and panels of the conference.\nConference proposed panels:\n\u2022 The EU after the Brexit: perspectives on the future of Europe\u2022 Perceptions of the Brexit process in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea Region\u2022 Rethinking Europe during the accession process of the the Baltic states, Finland and Sweden at the EU\u2022 Dividing Europe during the Cold War in the Baltic Sea Region: perspectives over the Iron Curtain\u2022 Imagining Europe in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea Region during the two world wars\u2022 Crafting Europe during the peace conferences\u2022 Rethinking Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea Region in Europe during the interwar period\u2022 Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea Region and the idea of Europe in history\u2022 The Vikings and the reconnecting of Europe\u2022 Rethinking Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea Region during the age of medieval monarchies\u2022 The emergence of modernity in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea Region\u2022 European lectureships at Nordic and Baltic universities\u2022 Teaching in English versus teaching in smaller languages\u2022 Recent influences of the English language on Scandinavian and Baltic languages\u2022 European literary influences in the North\u2022 Cultural relations between the Nordic and the Baltic countries and the rest of Europe\nRoundtable\nFrom the fall of Communism to Brexit: is the EU a success?\nThe Conference Schedule and Deadlines\n\u2022 Publication of the call for papers: 1 February 2020\u2022 Proposals for panels and roundtables (approx. 500 words): 15 March 2020\u2022 Abstracts for individual papers (approx. 300 words): 15 March 2020\u2022 Notification of acceptance: 25 March 2020\u2022 Publication of the conference program: 30 March 2020\u2022 Conference: 28-29 May 2020\u2022 Deadline for submitting the conference articles: 30 June 2020\u2022 Publication of conference articles: 30 September 2020 and 15 December 2020.\nKeynote addresses\nTo be confirmed by 1 March 2020\nSubmission\nThe submission web page for EURethink2020 is\u00a0https://easychair.org/ conferences/?conf= eurethink2020.\nPublication\nEURehink2020 proceedings will be published in The Romanian Journal for Baltic and Nordic Studies, vol. 12, issue 1 and 2 (2020).\nVenue\nThe conference will be held in\u00a0T\u00e2rgu Mure?, in central Romania, some 120 km away from Cluj-Napoca and 325 km from the capital of Romania, Bucharest.The opening of the conference is scheduled on 28 May 2020, 11-12 AM, in the glittering Small Hall of the\u00a0Palace of Culture\u00a0of T\u00e2rgu Mure?.The panels of the conference will be held on 28 May, from 2 to 7 PM, and on 29 May, from 9 AM to 3 PM in the\u00a0Medieval Citadel of T\u00e2rgu Mure?.The official reception offered by the organizers is scheduled on 28 May, 8 PM.

Dr. Costel Coroban, The Romanian Association for Baltic and Nordic Studies & Ovidius University of Constan?a\nPast conferences\nThe conference continues and develops a project that the Romanian Association for Baltic and Nordic Studies (ARSBN) initiated in 2010, aiming at investigating, comparing and describing the relations, encounters, intersections, confluences, mutual influences and/or parallels between the Nordic and Baltic Sea areas, on the one hand, and the Black Sea Region, on the other hand. The project was structured in annual international conferences. Thus, the first conference, entitled \u201cRomania and Lithuania in the interwar international relations: bonds, intersections and encounters\u201d was held on 19-21 May 2010 in T\u00e2rgovi?te and concentrated, as the title suggests, on the present and historical relations between the two countries belonging to these two areas. The following editions of the annual ARSBN conference enlarged their scope, being entitled \u201cThe Black Sea and the Baltic Sea regions: confluences, influences and crosscurrents in the modern and contemporary ages\u201d (T\u00e2rgovi?te, 20-22 May 2011), \u201cEuropean networks: the Balkans, Scandinavia and the Baltic World in a time of economic and ideological crisis\u201d (T\u00e2rgovi?te, 25-27 May 2012), \u201cEmpire-building and region-building in the Baltic, North and Black Sea areas\u201d (Constan?a, 24-26 May 2013), \u201cA piece of culture, a culture of peace, re-imaging European communities in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions\u201d (T\u00e2rgovi?te, 17-19 August 2014), \u201cHistorical memory, the politics of memory and cultural identity: Romania, Scandinavia and Baltic Sea Region in comparison\u201d (Constan?a, 22-23 May 2015), \u201cGood governance in Romania and the Nordic and Baltic countries\u201d (Bucharest, 24-25 November 2016), \u201cFinland, Romania, Roma integration \u2013 Learning from each other\u201d (Bucharest, 9 October 2017), and \u201c100 Years since Modern Independence and Unification in the Baltic Sea Region and East-Central Europe\u201d (T\u00e2rgovi?te, 15-16 November 2018) and \u201eDissent versus conformism in the Nordic, Baltic and Black Sea areas\u201d (Constan?a, 6-8 June 2019).During its previous ten editions, the ARSBN conference addressed fundamental problems within the current agenda of the Nordic, Baltic and Black sea states and contributed with fresh ideas and innovative research results to the general knowledge in the scientific field. Moreover, the conference advanced draft proposals useful to the European decision-makers of different fields.While the participants to the first two editions of the conference concentrated rather on the historical dimension of the relations, the following editions brought together specialists from various fields (political science, economics, international relations, minority studies, cultural studies, mnemonic studies, etc.) and addressed, besides the historical aspect of relations, other aspects relevant to the present time, i.e. the global economic crisis, the Balkan organized crime in Nordic Europe, region-building processes, the minorities in the Baltic Sea area and in the Balkans, the Roma minority integration, the remembrance of 1918, dissent and conformism, etc.\nContact\nAll questions about submissions should be emailed to\u00a0baltoskandia@gmail.com\u00a0or\u00a0welcome@rethinkingeurope.com.\nWebpages of the conference\nhttps://balticnordic. hypotheses.org/conference2020http://www.rethinkingeurope. com\n\n https://balticnordic.hypotheses.org/conference2020\n\n\n baltoskandia@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "University of Rhode Island Interdisciplinary Graduate Student Conference", "location": "NA", "organization": "NA", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-04-11\r\n                        to 2020-04-11", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-01", "description": "The University of Rhode Island\n14th Annual Interdisciplinary Graduate Student Conference\nThinking Big with AI and Automation\nApril 11, 2020\n\u00a0\nKeynote Speaker: To Be Announced\n\u00a0\nWe would like to encourage graduate students from all disciplines to submit projects they are currently working on, or have completed in the past, which speak across disciplines and evoke conversations with scholars in other fields that might complement their work.\n\u00a0\nThis conference has always been and will continue to be, an open forum for new critical methods, interdisciplinary projects, poster projects, and an amalgam of discussions that could lead to future collaboration.

Terrorism has become an imminent threat in advanced, democratic societies, as demonstrated by the United Kingdom suffering three large-scale terrorist attacks in 2017; the phenomenon of \u201clone-wolf terrorism\u201d has become of particular concern whereby acts of political violence are committed by individuals who are operating independently of any organized terrorist group which makes them inherently more difficult to identify in advance of an attack.\n\u00a0\nObjectives of the BookThis book will aim to explore the shifting definitions and implications of mass violence including whether independently acting terrorists adapt their strategies to cope with broader social changes, such as in Europe where there has been an increase in the number of motor vehicle attacks. In addition, this book will aim to investigate the premise that the perpetrators\u2019 decision regarding their choice of weapon(s) to carry out their planned mass violence is based upon their accessibility to particular weapons. As an action, terrorism is an attention-seeking behavior as a means of showcasing their mass violence against a particular person, group or institution. The ways in which these individuals are promoting their actions is also evolving with more individuals making use of technology to disseminate their manifesto prior to the incidents while some individuals using live streaming to broadcast their incidents of mass violence as they transpire. This book will also explore ways in which to prevent these incidents before they occur which presents its own challenge since previous research has indicated that there is no single accurate profile of a \u201clone wolf terrorist\u201d or other active killer; however, they do share common goals and motivations for their mass murdering sprees as well as display commonalities in their indirect and direct warning behaviors.\n\u00a0\nTarget AudienceThe target audience of this book will be composed of professionals, practitioners, and researchers working in the fields of conflict analysis and resolution, crisis management (natural and man-made), law enforcement, mental health, academia, education, psychology, sociology, criminology, criminal justice, other social sciences, cyber-terrorism, counter-terrorism, threat analysis, etc.\n\u00a0\nRecommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shifting definitions of what constitutes mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motivations underlying mass acts of violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The news media\u2019s representation of acts of mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general public\u2019s understanding of mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motives for committing mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The methods utilized in the commission of mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The choice of weapons to commit mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The means for counteracting the evolution of weapons of mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The strategies for counteracting the evolving methods of mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perspectives for comprehending the motivations and issues contributing to mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examining the role of technology in mass killers\u2019 promotion of their infamous activities\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Managing threats and potential solutions to mitigating mass violence\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk assessment measures\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direct and Indirect \u201cred flag\u201d behaviors of active killers\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reporting and Dissemination of information regarding potential threats\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Potential for a centralized database for threat tracking\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The contextual implications for the suitability of threat assessment and identification measures\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nSubmission ProcedureResearchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before\u00a0March 15, 2020, a full chapter.

This year\u2019s conference will interrogate frames of justice, criminality, deviancy, and resistance.\nJacques Derrida states that justice \u201cis that which must not wait.\u201d At the same time, he acknowledges the paradox that justice has yet to arrive: \u201cjustice remains, is yet, to come,\u00a0venir.\u201d In Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail,\u201d King describes the \u201cmyth of time\u201d that society propagates to maintain social, class, and racial hierarchies. The government, media, and public caution marginalized peoples to \u201cbe patient\u201d and \u201cwait\u201d\u2014they say that justice will come in time. Through this spiritual bypassing, society can falsely, but effectively, accuse those fighting for justice as \u201cagitators\u201d and \u201cincendiaries.\u201d The fight for justice thus becomes framed as criminal and deviant behavior. MLK resists this framing in his letter when he urges us to see that \u201c\u2018justice too long delayed is justice denied.\u2019\u201d This tension between justice yet to come and justice that cannot be delayed demonstrates the complicated, variant, and urgent purviews of justice.\nCCC 2020 seeks submissions that explore the broad concepts of \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ccriminality,\u201d or \u201cdeviancy.\u201d Whether it is the media and government\u2019s targeting of civil rights activists in the 1960s, the policing of black, indigenous, poor, and migrant folks, or in the criminalization of LGTBTQ+ identities, \u201cdeviance\u201d is punished by society. Thus, \u201cjustice framed\u201d can mean anything from social justice activism to the ways in which \u201cjustice\u201d is used to advance oppression.\u00a0While the theme asks that we think about the many ways that justice is \u201cframed\u201d (e.g. how it is formulated, how it is repudiated, and how it is abstracted), it also asks that we radically and consciously reimagine what justice could be. For if we take seriously Angela Davis\u2019s assertion that \u201cjustice is indivisible,\u201d then we must also consider her declaration: \u201cYou\u00a0have to\u00a0act as if it were possible to radically transform the world. And you have to do it all the time.\u201d\nPossible areas of focus might include but are not limited to the following:\nWho do current \u201cjustice\u201d systems protect, and who do they target / harm?Transformative, restorative, and other forms of justice in comparison to punitive justice systemsWhat should be the responsibilities, duties, and actions of those who witness\u00a0injustice?\u00a0What does an \u201cethical / moral witness\u201d to\u00a0injustice\u00a0look like?The role of storytelling, art, and humanities in transforming our ideas of justice and criminalityResistance and revolutionary movements or actsWho does society define as criminals or deviants?

Courses and conferences devoted to his work have been and are being held regularly in universities all over the globe, while the amount of scholarly work on him shows no sign of diminishing. It is not only that few recent thinkers can count within their oeuvre masterworks of the importance of The Claim of Reason and The World Viewed. It is not even just the breadth of his research interests \u2013 encompassing topics as varied as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Shakespeare, film, democracy, education and literature, to name just a few \u2013 that makes Cavell\u2019s production so significant. It is his capacity delve deeply into the technical debates of academic philosophy and humanities whilst, at the same time, attaining a truly distinctive voice. His prominence is due not only to his work as a scholar, but also as a writer and intellectual. For such reasons, Cavell invites us to problematize and reinvent philosophy in a manner important to our academic institutions as well as our society at large.\nVita-Salute San Raffaele University of Milan, in partnership with the art and design museum Triennale di Milano, will host a two-day interdisciplinary international conference on Cavell\u2019s philosophy and figure. The call for papers encourages a variety of approaches and contributions, addressing scholars in the fields of history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, political theory and philosophy of language, as well as those working in film studies, comparative literature, North American studies, gender studies, visual and cultural studies, intellectual history and history of ideas. The aim of the conference will be not only to deepen the present understanding of Cavell\u2019s thought through the analysis and interpretation of specific aspects of his production, but also to open new lines of interaction with other thinkers and topics both within and beyond the academic study of philosophy.\n\u00a0\nThe conference will be structured around thematic sessions.\nTopics of interest for submission include, but are not limited to:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 America and transcendentalism: Emerson, Thoreau and beyond.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inheriting a method?

It asks: which new perspectives and visions have been developed over the last 50 years within Indigenous studies and related fields when looking at Indigenous land and land rights, Indigenous political and social sovereignty, extractivism and environmental destruction, oppressive sex/gender systems, and for describing the repercussions of settler colonialism in North America, especially in narrative representations?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The symposium is guided by the idea that North American Indigenous intellectual and narrative traditions developed and recovered since the 1960s offer new and reclaimed ways of being, organizing, and thinking in the face of destruction, dispossession, and oppression; Indigenous ways of writing and righting are connected to ongoing social struggles for land rights, access to clean water, and intellectual and socio-political sovereignty; they are, as Maile Arvin, Eve Tuck, and Angie Morrill (2013) have pointed out, \u201ca gift\u201d from which most academic disciplines can benefit greatly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the face of ongoing exploitations of Indigenous knowledges and resources, it is paramount that researchers who focus on Indigenous intellectual and narrative traditions, especially those who come from settler-colonial backgrounds, carefully examine their implications in settler-colonial ways of dispossession. It is in this context that the symposium encourages self-reflectivity and invites participants from all positionalities to include reflections on how to act, think, and write in a non-appropriative manner about the intellectual achievements of Indigenous academics, activists, artists from North America. What kind of challenges does an engagement with Indigenous intellectual and narrative achievements from North America pose, and how do these achievements enable their audience to think differently and to develop visions that go beyond settler colonial hegemonies that make themselves felt in customs, laws, property-relations, or gender roles?\n\u00a0\nPossible topics include:\nNorth American Indigenous intellectual and narrative traditions that emerged or were rediscovered over the last 50 years;\u00a0Indigenous representations of land and water, community-building, the other-than-human world;\u00a0connections and frictions among and within different Indigenous traditions and/or settler societies in North America; \u00a0Indigenous understandings of sex/gender;methodologies for reading across ethnic divides, alliance-building tools in academia and activism.\u00a0\nPlease send your proposals (max. 300 words) plus a short bio (max. 150 words) to in_the_wake@outlook.com by March 15, 2020.

Miguel Carrera)\nDeadline: june 15, 2020\nOne of the characteristics that define fictional production in the 21st\u00a0century is its tendency to distribute itself among numerous media of expression: television, cinema, literature, comic-books, theater, video games, role-playing games, etc. Far from leading to dispersion or to the proliferation of watertight compartments, such inclination \u2013 also present in other communicative practices \u2013 has led to the convergence of all these areas. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult, even inappropriate, to limit the focus of attention to a single medium and ignore the rest: stories expand to two, three or more of these environments, aspiring to preserve the unity of sense in heterogeneity. Thus, to get to a thorough and complete understanding of the message, the recipient \u2013 and, therefore, the critic \u2013 has to consider different creative domains and apply several reading codes. This agent is simultaneously endowed, in contemporary creation, with a much more active and decisive role than he/she used to possess. Expected to interact with fictional products, as a member of a participatory and empowered culture, his/her intervention \u2013 often essential \u2013 oscillates between the interpellation and analysis from various discussion forums \u2013 especially the Internet and social networks \u2013 and direct participation in the imaginary universes, either expanding them in media different from than the one where they originated, or immersing themselves effectively in those worlds and influencing \u2013 either as an avatar, or playing a character \u2013 the course of the action.\nThese two complementary trends point to the terms on which the proposed monograph is based: transmedia(lity) and interactivity. Its goal: to trace the importance of these realities in the fantastic genre or mode, both in theoretical formulations and practical realizations.\nWidely addressed in akin modalities such as science fiction or medieval fantasy (think, for example, of successful franchises, and recurring objects of analysis, such as\u00a0Star Wars,\u00a0A Song of Ice and Fire\u00a0or\u00a0Lord of the Rings, which transcended their original medium long ago, and where the interference of fans has become the norm), the concept of\u00a0transmedial, or\u00a0transmedia, has not had, to date, much repercussion in studies on the fantastic, at least as\u00a0Brumal\u00a0conceives it (that is, as the irruption of the impossible into a world in appearance similar to ours, in tune with Caillois\u2019s and Roas\u2019s theories). As for interactivity, it also has not received the due attention yet, despite the interest raised in recent years by expressions rarely considered artistic in the past, like video games, haunted attractions, fan fiction, \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d novels, etc. That is why it is urgent to undertake a project like the current one, in which we analyze, among other things, how speeches and stories have migrated from one medium to another \u2013 if that was not designed like that from the beginning \u2013, to what extent inter-dependence between the different media has been promoted, and how, in this process, the community of readers, spectators, players or, in general, fans has played an increasingly active and crucial role. It is at this junction, or convergence, between the transmedia(l) and the interactive towards which we want the participants of the issue to look.\nMain themes:\nBrumal\u00a0will only consider works of a fantastic nature as defined\u00a0by the journal, hereby only accepting papers on other non-mimetic genres such as the marvellous or science fiction if and when they are related to fantastic narrative.\nMiscellaneous Section\nThis Miscellaneous section is open all year to receive any type of article on any of the diverse artistic manifestations of the fantastic (narrative, theater, film, comics, painting, photography, video games), whether theoretical, critical, historical or comparative in nature, concerning the fantastic in any language or from any country, from the nineteenth century to the present.\nURL:\u00a0https://revistes.uab.cat/brumal/pages/view/callforpaper\n\n https://revistes.uab.cat/brumal/pages/view/callforpaper\n\n\n mcarreragarrido@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Travel Studies - NEPCA 2020 Conference (Northeast Popular Culture Association Annual Meeting, 2020)", "location": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "organization": "Organization: Northeast Popular Culture Association", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-23\r\n                        to 2020-10-24", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-06-01", "description": "The Northeast Popular Culture Association (NEPCA) will hold its 2020 conference October 23-24 at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, NH.\n\u00a0\nThe Travel Studies Area of NEPCA invites paper proposals on the subject of travel and tourism, broadly conceived.\u00a0 Paper proposals may include (but are not limited to) analysis and critical perspectives on topics such as:\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Depictions of travel in art, film, literature, and television\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Historic sites, museums, and monuments\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 History of travel and tourism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marketing of travel and tourism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material culture and travel (i.e. souvenirs)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Militourism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moral perspectives on travel and tourism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specialty travel (i.e. business, educational, religious)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transportation\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Travel accommodations (i.e. hotels, motels)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Travel and tour companies\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Travel media (i.e. television programs, websites)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Travel writing (i.e. narratives, guidebooks, blogs)\n\u00a0\nProposals for individual papers as well as complete panels are welcome.\u00a0 Please submit paper proposals through the NEPCA online submission form: https://nepca.blog/conference.\n\u00a0\nFor more information, please see the NEPCA website: https://nepca.blog/\n\u00a0\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: JUNE 1, 2020.\n\u00a0\n\n https://nepca.blog/conference/\n\n\n mvanells@qcc.cuny.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "Multiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention 2020 Call for Submissions (Multiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention)", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "organization": "Organization: Multiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-16\r\n                        to 2020-10-18", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-06-30", "description": "Call for SubmissionsMultiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention\u00a0Event Date & Location: October 16-October 18, 2020, Westin Atlanta Perimeter North, 7 Concourse Parkway in Sandy Springs\nDeadline for Submissions:\u00a0June 30, 2020\nName of Organization:\u00a0Multiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention\nOrganization Website: https://www.multiversecon.org\nContact Email:\u00a0Rhonda Jackson Joseph, Learn@Multiversecon.org\nCONVENTION THEME:\nMultiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention was formed from our belief that great stories don\u2019t only come from the books and comics we love to read. Each fan is their own universe as well, with their own unique story to tell.

In this light, we seek to create a multidisciplinary academic program that will showcase the innumerable ways speculative fiction is inspired by various branches of academia.\u00a0\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES:\nMultiverse Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention is seeking academic presentations of 15, 25, and 45 minutes in length for our 2020 convention. While we require presentations to reflect rigorous academic scholarship, we are not requesting conference paper readings. Presentations only, please.\nWe are seeking presentations that approach an academic topic in a way that non-academic audiences will find accessible and entertaining. Ideally, presentations will incorporate a core theme or topic of interest to speculative fiction fans.\nExample topics may include, but are not limited to:\n?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An interesting historical event that garners immense speculation.

At the centre of the conference will be the relation between the writer and his native city, but papers about all aspects of his work and life will be welcome.\n\u201cI do not come before you as a stranger. I was born in Edinburgh. I spent my boyhood there. I was educated at the University, and I graduated there. I owe much to the old City\u201d (Arthur Conan Doyle, The Edinburgh Evening Dispatch 25th Sept 1900.) Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh on the 22nd of May 1859, and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh from 1876 to 1881. Famously, Dr Joseph Bell, one of his professors, was said to be the inspiration for the character Sherlock Holmes.\u00a0 Although Conan Doyle only spent 12 years of his life in Edinburgh, it was the city which shaped him and out of which his stories grew. As Val McDermid notes: \u201cthose early years in Edinburgh played a crucial role in his development as a writer\u201d (2009). This conference will explore the interplay between city and writer, and we invite broad, imaginative and interdisciplinary interpretations on the topic of \u2018Conan Doyle in Edinburgh\u2019. We also welcome proposals for papers on other topics concerning the writings and life of Arthur Conan Doyle.\nKey note speakers: Owen Dudley Edwards and Nicholas Daly\nWe will also be running a virtual conference alongside the physical conference which we hope will encourage greater participation for those unable to attend for financial, environmental or other reasons. If selected, the online participants will be asked to record their presentation which will be hosted on our website before, during and after the conference. Viewers and attendees of the conference will have the opportunity to ask questions of the online participants.

Interdisciplinarity, both as theory and as critical practice, is of special importance to fields within the humanities and social sciences. Dame Gillian Beer argues that interdisciplinarity fosters the transformation of ideas and the destabilisation of knowledge, and thus helps to \u201cuncover problems disguised by the scope of established disciplines\u201d (Open Fields 115).\u00a0 However, the trend toward interdisciplinarity is also, in part, a response to the current crisis in higher education, as scholars across the curriculum work to articulate their value in the face of the neoliberalization of our institutions and \u201cdiscipline\u201d in the form of eroding budgets, increasing workloads, and the adjunctification of our faculties.\n\u00a0\nThe Ohio State University\u2019s 7th Annual Medieval and Renaissance Graduate Student Symposium, therefore, invites submissions that consider discipline and interdisciplinarity, as concept or practice, in relation to the subfields within medieval and early modern studies. This symposium asks:\n\u00b7How do our individual disciplines \u201cdiscipline\u201d us?\n\u00b7How do we, as scholars and critics, participate in the nature, creation, and policing of disciplinary boundaries?\n\u00b7What is the role of interdisciplinarity in the periodicity and historiography of the medieval and early modern periods?\n\u00b7What kinds of objects or subjects transgress disciplinary boundaries or resist a unidisciplinary approach?\n\u00b7How can studying medieval and early modern interdisciplinarity help to inform the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity for us today?\n\u00b7What possibilities do historical conceptions of knowledge offer us for fighting back against disciplining within academia and the culture more generally?\n\u00b7How can studying the medieval and early modern worlds facilitate the social justice work that we envision as part and parcel of our scholarship? What is our responsibility, as scholars of our collective histories, to do such work?\n\u00b7Other subjects of interest may include: Gender, sexuality, and queer studies; class, canon-formation, and cultural capital; race, imperialism, and the global Middle Ages/Renaissance; material cultures; theorizing the archive/library; technology and the digital humanities; cultural exchange and performance; borders and migration; and pre-modern reception in subsequent eras.\n\u00a0\nWe invite submissions by graduate students from all disciplines with particular attention paid to proposals that examine the specific theme of Discipline and Interdisciplinarity.

Its theme focuses on Changing the World: Community, Science and Engagement with Big History. The IBHA has held conferences on meaning, teaching and research, and so now will address issues of community and change around our planet. In other words: How can big history help us in its application to world issues?\nIndia is a powerhouse of innovative development, with cultural and intellectual traditions reaching back thousands of years. Symbiosis is an embodiment of this heritage and enterprise, a truly modern synthesis. Situated along the Mula-Mutha River, its six campuses in the city of Pune lie on the Deccan Plateau, 600 meters above the Arabian Sea.\nFounded in 1971, Symbiosis International University was begun with the intent of providing a \u201chome away from home\u201d for African and Asian students studying in India. Its students come from more than 85 countries, so, appropriately, their Sanskrit motto is ?????? ?????????? \u2013 Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam \u2013 \u201cThe World is One Family.\u201d A not-for-profit university, Symbiosis serves almost 30,000 students.\nOur conference will be co-sponsored by and held at the Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts, one of the university\u2019s most innovative programmes. Founded in 2011, SSLA was the first liberal arts school in an Indian university and remains the only four-year degree, an Honours programme. It is home to the India Association for Big History, which formed in 2016.\nIn 2018, the first course in Big History began at SSLA, \u2018Humanity and Big History: Our Challenge for Survival\u2019. The course grew out of SSLA\u2019s Anthropology Department and is co-taught by an historian and a physicist. It is a core course for all third year undergraduates. In March 2018, SSLA sponsored the First Annual Conference of Interdisciplinarity and Big History with the Asian Big History Association and J.F. Oberlin University (Tokyo), as well as the IBHA.\nThe conference will take place during the first week of August 2020. We have reserved Symbiosis-approved guest houses for accommodations, which are near to the SSLA campus. Rickshaws as well as Uber and Ola cabs are available, and Symbiosis will provide a bus at the start and end of each day. The accommodations, as well as meals and tea at the campus dining hall, will be available at a reasonable rate. For example, double-occupancy rooms will run at about ?2000 ($30) a day.\nAttendees are invited to arrive during the weekend of August 1st and 2nd. The Pune International Airport is less than a kilometre from our campus. You can check into your rooms, then relax and socialize with friends and colleagues. On Sunday at mid-day, we will arrange for a short tour of the city, followed by tea and a welcome presentation orienting you to India.\nThe conference panels will begin Monday morning and run through Thursday morning, August 3rd through 6th. On Monday and Tuesday evening, there will be interactive plenary panel presentations and a courtyard dinner. On Wednesday afternoon and evening, there will be festival on the theme of engaged creativity of South Asia. On Thursday morning, August 6th, we will have an IBHA members\u2019 assembly.\n\n https://bighistory.org/members/conferences/2020-2/2020-registration/\n\n\n lucy.laffitte@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Modernism's Everyday Precarities (MSA Brooklyn 2020) (MSA Brooklyn 2020)", "location": "Brooklyn", "organization": "Organization: Modernist Studies Association", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-22\r\n                        to 2020-10-25", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-05", "description": "MSA Brooklyn 2020: Streets\n\u00a0\nPanel: Modernism\u2019s Everyday Precarities\n\u00a0\nCritical narratives of the modernist everyday have illustrated the ways modernist artists capture the ordinariness of ordinary life by representing the unrepresentable. What these narratives have neglected is the extraordinary breadth of possibility and therefore contingency these artists take on by drawing our attention to the quotidian, routine, trivial, and the actual. When Heidegger defines Being by applying Hegel\u2019s \"indeterminate immediate,\" he puts us in a state of constant, everyday suspense regarding what happens to us and how we're supposed to feel about it. When Lefebvre bares his Marxist critique of everyday life, he reveals social disconnection and personal incompleteness as cultural effects of post-industrial modernity. Under the condition of Lefebvre\u2019s alienation, we wonder, what quotidian precarities are we vulnerable to? The contingency of everyday life involves a variety of ways poetic and cinematic subjects relate to the world, may it be,\u00a0serendipity in Pound\u2019s beautiful encounters in the subway,\u00a0ennui in Joyce's routine errands in\u00a0Ulysses, solidarity in Vertov\u2019s\u00a0Man with a Movie Camera, spontaneity in O\u2019Hara\u2019s afternoon strolls in\u00a0Lunch Poems, impatience in Varda\u2019s\u00a0Cleo from 5 to 7. But on any ordinary day, there also lurks the threat of accidents and mishaps: Freud forgets his keys, Dielman drops her spoon, Keaton slips on a banana. The ordinary act of walking the streets becomes a site of extraordinary possibility; between each step, Benjamin says, lies \u201cthe optical unconscious.\u201d Drawing attention to these unconscious and precarious spaces may serve as a way of clarifying uncertainties, revealing what it is we\u2019ve missed or can\u2019t control. Conversely, art may serve as a way of reveling in the unknown, being a form of radical play. Through this panel we ask, what are the formal, affective, social, and political stakes for modernism\u2019s incorporation of everyday precarities? We more than welcome projects that ask such questions across different forms of media and genre.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTopics may include:\n\u00a0\n-How socio-political and historical contexts change the ways art manages uncertainty.\n-How the everyday domestic setting differs from the public sphere.\n-What formal innovations solicit a feeling of uncertainty.\n-How modernist precarity is similar or different from 21st century precarity.\n-What the relationship is between the unrepresentable and the uncertain.\n-How a state of mind, being \u201cabsent\u201d or \u201cpresent\u201d or somewhere between, gives rise to these affectations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease submit a 250-word abstract (and a short bio) for 15-18 minute paper by March 5, 2020, to Noa Saunders at noars@bu.edu and Lucy Alford at lalford@uchicago.edu.\n\n noars@bu.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "CFP Special Issue: Keep on Rolling Under the Stars - Green Readings on the Beat Generation", "location": "N/A", "organization": "Organization: University College Roosevelt, Utrecht University, Netherlands", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-31\r\n                        to 2020-10-31", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-10-31", "description": "The Beat Generation promoted transnational literatures of resistance, and green readings of their work remains lacking. The Beat Generation was a transnational group of literary bohemians, and the relevance of their work might seem limited to the immediate postwar period. The problem of climate change has long been a source of inspiration for authors, and existing scholarship acknowledges this fact. Nonetheless, important questions remain. Can the environmental humanities contribute to current debates surrounding the Beat Generation? Can scholarly activities help resolve the many aesthetic and moral questions the Beat Generation confronts us with? Grace and Skerl argue as recently as 2018 that there is still a need for wider academic recognition of the Beat project, and recent trends in the environmental humanities can bring new conceptual and theoretical understanding to the Beat project. While the environmental humanities have made a broad intervention into literature over the past decades, what remains surprising is the lack of engagement with the profound philosophical and literary movement of the Beats. Connecting ecology to the Beats should not be that surprising. In his pioneering 1995 study, Steven Watson noted key aspects of the Beat Generation that resonate today, including the \"spread of ecological consciousness,\" a wider \"opposition to the military-industrial machine civilization,\" \"[r]espect for land and indigenous peoples, and \"[l]ess rich conspicuous consumption\" (304). History suggests that Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Michael McClure are the Beat writers most clearly interested in finding some kind of \"reconnection with the natural world\" (Phillips). Interesting too is that William Burroughs at times also expressed a deep \"yearning for a return to a more pastoral\u2014and even, at times, more primitive\u2014existence.\" Gregory Stephenson further maintains that the influence of the Beat Generation may be discerned in nearly every aspect of the counterculture, including the denunciation of material concerns and careerism, increasing pacifism, and even a green anarchist philosophy that echoes Thoreau. Thus, it would seem that green readings on writers affiliated with the Beat Generation can benefit from reconsideration. Gary Snyder holds a prominent position in Beat lore and is widely acknowledged for his green poetic vision, but more research \"might challenge stereotypical views of the Beats as hedonists who also happened to write\" (Weidner). This Special Issue welcomes green readings on the Beats defined in a very broad sense, and includes not just the core members, but also women, the post-Beats, and contemporary writers, artists, and musicians that are heavily influenced by the Beat project. As such, this Special Issue seeks to trace the ecological arc of the Beats from the earliest manifestations to the present day.\n\n https://www.mdpi.com/journal/humanities/special_issues/green_readings\n\n\n c.weidner@ucr.nl\n\n"}, {"title": "Call for Papers on Pedagogy for the CEA Critic", "location": "N/A", "organization": "Organization: College English Association", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2023-12-31", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2023-12-31", "description": "The CEA Critic : The Official Journal of the College English Association (rolling deadline)\nGeneral Editor: Jeraldine Kraver / University of Northern ColoradoManaging Editor: Molly Desjardins / University of Northern Colorado\u00a0\nEditorial Assistant: Winsome Lewis / University of Northern Colorado\u00a0\nJournal contact email: CRITICUNCO@gmail.com\nAs a national organization, the College English Association (CEA) was first established in 1938 to foster excellence in teaching and scholarship.

In this way, The CEA Critic celebrates the importance of literary criticism from a variety of approaches and the value of reading and teaching familiar and unfamiliar literary works. We are also interested in articles that consider pedagogy from a theoretical perspective or engage issues pertinent to all aspects of rhetoric and composition. Our goal is to provide a refreshingly sharp academic and practical perspective for teachers and scholars alike.

Last year marked the 50-year commemoration of the Stonewall riots, which gave birth to the concept, convention and ethos of Pride. However, to quote the words of great thinker and scholar Michel Foucault, \u201cjustice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions\u201d (Lib\u00e9ration, 1983). As the year 2020 heralds a new decade and era, we ruminate on the great strides made by our forerunners as regards claiming civil victories and actively voicing concerns, and we turn to the future of the movement and the community by thinking our next step.\nIn light of EuroPride 2020 taking place in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, we will take this opportunity to evaluate the progress of the LGBTQI movement in Europe. Standing at a crossroads between East and West as well as being one of the largest socioeconomic cores of the Balkan area, Thessaloniki has for centuries been a cosmopolitan hub nuanced by all sorts of cultural expressions and notions. It is this aspect of the host city of this year\u2019s EuroPride that inspired the title for this conference. Intersections can be thought of as meeting points of diverse elements; common points of reference; points that despite differences\u2014or, even, because of them\u2014cross and influence one another; ultimately, points of convergence. In a similar vein, Europe has been a terrain of social, political and economic forces that operate on different gears. Currently, with far-right politics climaxing in many European countries, Brexit triggering renegotiations among EU states, and immigrant mobility being a pressing issue, among others, the idea of Europe being (at) an intersectional ground is all the more prevalent and always debated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWith that being said, in what ways are LGBTQI rights in Europe developing?

Soprattutto non c\u2019\u00e8 scambio che non implichi operazioni\u00a0parassitarie: come ha sostenuto Michel Serres, non c\u2019\u00e8 attivit\u00e0 \u201cproduttiva\u201d che non causi, a cascata, parassiti (e parassiti di parassiti).\nIl\u00a0parassita\u00a0prende senza dare. Esso \u00e8 la sua stessa operazione, che consiste nel nutrirsi dell\u2019ambiente-ospite senza fornire niente in cambio. Il parassita sottrae valore, energia, mangia a sbafo, consuma. Eppure il parassita (la sua esistenza, la sua stessa nozione) ci inquieta e ci disturba perch\u00e9, desiderando distinguerci da esso, finiamo con l\u2019invidiarlo o per riconoscervi un eccesso di (segreta) somiglianza con noi. Forse per proteggerci da questa inconfessabile similarit\u00e0, e ripetendo cos\u00ec un\u2019inavvertita metafisica, postuliamo che al vertice di qualsiasi cascata parassitaria ci sia pur sempre (stata) una Causa Produttrice che crea\u00a0da s\u00e9\u00a0senza mai prendere (parassitariamente) da altri. Perch\u00e9, se non si postulasse l\u2019esistenza di tale Causa,\u00a0tutte\u00a0le attivit\u00e0 (umane e non umane) finirebbero per apparire parassitarie e, con un\u2019inversione improvvisa dell\u2019onere della prova, ci\u00f2 che sembrava un dato ontologico acquisito \u2013 vale a dire il primato della Produzione e della Potenza Creativa \u2013 apparirebbe proprio ci\u00f2 che bisognerebbe dimostrare e spiegare.\nUno dei paradossi del parassitismo \u00e8 che pu\u00f2 apparire, ed essere, aggressivo e predatorio\u00a0oppure\u00a0emancipativo e libertario. Il parassita \u2013 sia nei suoi connotati biologici che in quelli sociali \u2013 pu\u00f2 essere cos\u00ec violento da distruggere il suo ambiente ospite: si pensi alla relazione parassitaria tra le cellule cancerogene e l\u2019organismo che le ospita (apoptosi), o all\u2019Antropocene inteso come rapporto predatorio tra le societ\u00e0 umane industrializzate e il loro ambiente di vita. Ma \u00e8 possibile fare esempi di segno opposto: uno \u00e8 quello del\u00a0foodsharing\u00a0praticato in alcune grandi citt\u00e0 europee e organizzato in modo tale che le derrate alimentari non vendute (e destinate al macero) nelle catene della grande distribuzione possano essere prese da chiunque lo voglia, per qualsiasi motivo, senza dover chiedere a nessuno e in modo del tutto anonimo; un altro esempio, apparentemente ovvio e perci\u00f2 poco indagato o sprofondato nella storicit\u00e0 dell\u2019inconscio, \u00e8 il rapporto del tutto parassitario che abbiamo con le culture umane passate e presenti, da cui prendiamo senza dover contraccambiare.\nCi sono inoltre delle operazioni parassitarie\u00a0borderline\u00a0tra predazione e uso \u2018democratico\u2019 delle energie o informazioni disponibili, come quella, diffusissima, che consiste nel\u00a0craccare\u00a0le risorse informatiche e i contenuti culturali attraverso la rete Internet. Anche in questo caso il paradosso della relazione parassitaria \u00e8 che essa, prendendo solo ci\u00f2 che effettivamente serve oppure che sembra avere un\u00a0valore, risulta essere uno strumento indiretto di verifica di ci\u00f2 che in una data epoca o in un certo contesto sociale viene percepito non tanto come \u2018bene comune\u2019 (il che ci riporterebbe alla sopravvalutazione dello scambio), quanto piuttosto come segno o forza di cui non \u00e8 possibile fare a meno per vivere e soprattutto per\u00a0esistere\u00a0\u2013 come accadde, ad esempio, con il\u00a0Trattato del saper vivere ad uso delle giovani generazioni\u00a0di Raoul Vaneigem, famoso per essere stato il libro pi\u00f9 rubato a Parigi nel 1968. Se insomma il parassita sottrae per esistere ed esiste per sottrarre, c\u2019\u00e8 un possibile equivoco da dissipare: esso non prende soltanto per sopravvivere ma anche per creare\u00a0a suo modo, cio\u00e8 differisce, devia, gioca, trasforma, improvvisa, inventa, sperimenta \u2013 e al tempo stesso sa di non essere la Causa della sua creativit\u00e0: sa che ha bisogno che l\u2019ambiente ospite sia ricco abbastanza (sotto qualsiasi prospettiva), altrimenti non potrebbe sottrarre, esistere e creare a modo suo. Per tale ragione il parassita pu\u00f2 essere predatorio e violento (e per questo inconfessabilmente invidiato), ma non pu\u00f2 soffrire di invidia sociale. Analogamente, il parassitismo pu\u00f2 essere distruttivo e generare catastrofi, ma pu\u00f2 anche creare simbiosi e ibridazioni, quindi equilibri punteggiati, connessioni a-evolutive, rizomi.\nCom\u2019\u00e8 evidente, stiamo antropomorfizzando e psicologizzando il fenomeno parassitario solo per rendere pi\u00f9 icastiche le sue caratteristiche ontologiche. Nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi, le operazioni parassitarie sono infatti inavvertite, anonime, impersonali e, soprattutto, non umane. Da tale punto di vista riteniamo non casuale che il problema del parassitismo stia emergendo, accanto a quello della\u00a0simbiosi, in molte riflessioni teoriche contemporanee (biologia, ecologia, sociologia e di recente ontologia), connotando in modo significativo anche un campo di sperimentazione artistica. Ritornano cos\u00ec di attualit\u00e0, come spesso accade, autori che, nel passato, hanno indagato la questione parassitaria in splendido isolamento \u2013 ci riferiamo, in particolare, a Gabriel Tarde e Michel Serres \u2013, mentre ricerche teoriche innovative pi\u00f9 recenti o apparentemente specialistiche, come quella della biologa teorica Lynn Margulis, rivelano la loro intima connessione con ambiti disciplinari storicamente distanti.\nInfine, la relazione parassitaria deve poter essere interpretata anche nella prospettiva dell\u2019ambiente che ospita e che incontra il parassita senz\u2019averlo invitato. Il parassita \u00e8 un ospite non richiesto oppure qualcuno che si \u00e8 trattenuto troppo a lungo in casa, diventando invadente e oppressivo. Pur avendo compreso che, persino in questo caso, l\u2019ambiente\u00a0che ospita\u00a0\u00e8 a sua volta, spesso inavvertitamente,\u00a0ospitato\u00a0senza invito in altri ambienti-casa rispetto ai quali si comporta da parassita, il problema resta in tutta la sua crudezza: come liberarci di un essere che ci opprime, sottraendoci energie e togliendoci la libert\u00e0? Certo, anche senza dover giungere agli eccessi \u201cpadronali\u201d di Ulisse nei confronti dei Proci, \u00e8 possibile combattere il parassita per cos\u00ec dire imponendogli (ma neanche tanto) un\u00a0contratto d\u2019affitto, un contratto etico, economico, politico che, di volta in volta, delimiti e salvaguardi la nostra area di libert\u00e0. Ma si danno casi nei quali la relazione parassitaria non \u00e8 percepita come tale dall\u2019ospite, anzi \u00e8 sentita paradossalmente come dono (!) di libert\u00e0 e non come sua limitazione, il che eccede in termini psico-semantici i casi in cui la relazione, ancorch\u00e9 vitale, non \u00e8 percepita affatto, tranne che in condizioni patologiche \u2013 si pensi alla flora batterica che ospitiamo nel nostro intestino. Avremo allora i casi-limite, i casi-eccezione in cui sembra accadere ci\u00f2 che chiamiamo\u00a0rapporto d\u2019amore, e in cui si esperisce l\u2019eccedenza di senso o anche l\u2019eccesso patetico del parassitismo: se si accetta che l\u2019altro/a prenda tutto ci\u00f2 che desidera, anzi se si desidera che l\u2019altro/a ci parassiti del tutto, che ci prenda tutto, \u00e8 forse perch\u00e9 lo/la si ama \u2013 o ci troviamo di fronte a una sopravvalutazione del parassitismo analoga a quella della relazione di scambio? D\u2019altra parte, proprio alla luce di questa insinuazione, la relazione parassitaria potrebbe configurarsi come una sorta di\u00a0loop\u00a0della materia vivente \u2013 come un pattern semplice ed elastico, in grado di liquidare ogni residuo antropomorfismo.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn ogni caso, riflettere sui parassiti ci porter\u00e0 fuori dall\u2019ambito (non solo economicamente) ristretto dello scambio, consentendoci di vedere cose che altrimenti non vedremmo. Se infatti, come dicevamo all\u2019inizio, la nozione di scambio appare sovrastimata, la polivalenza di quella parassitaria \u00e8 ancora (di)sconosciuta. Perci\u00f2 invitiamo lettori e studiosi ad inviarci proposte di contributi che la esplorino in tutti gli ambiti e le direzioni: in campo propriamente scientifico, con particolare riguardo all\u2019ecologia e alla biologia; nella dimensione teoretica, che \u00e8 oggi soprattutto ontologica; nell\u2019ambito delle scienze umane, con contributi dedicati alla psicologia e alla sociologia del parassitismo, ma anche di carattere estetico o etico-politico; in quello letterario o cinematografico, e nelle dimensioni ibride della tecnologia e delle arti applicate.\n\u00a0\nCall for Abstracts\nSi prega di inviare gli abstracts in formato .docx (massimo 5.000 caratteri, spazi inclusi; in italiano, francese, inglese o tedesco) all\u2019indirizzo email della caporedattrice Eleonora de Conciliis (eleonora.deconciliis@libero.it) entro il\u00a015 marzo 2020.

Once considered a fringe movement, neoliberalism has steadily become the central tenet of American life. It is now nearly impossible, for example, to imagine any mainstream voice espousing tax hikes or championing the sorts of policies enacted under Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson. Promises of privatization today trump collective action in virtually every aspect of life. This epistemic shift can be felt far and wide, from politicians to postmodern theorists. Given the focus of the SAMLA conference in 2020 in Jacksonville, FL, we have a special interest in papers that explore how neoliberalism breaks the rules, or how it creates new rules to be broken. The panel will investigate symptoms of/responses to this ideological shift, particularly in the areas of literature and media studies.

Europe has become increasingly represented as existing in an unstable balance and an indeterminate future, between the ties of the local and the appeals of authenticity, on the one hand, and, on the other, the challenges of globalization and the confrontation of identities.\nThus, the European continent becomes more and more legible and interpretable by means of conceptual tools pertaining to what has come to be called area studies, and which presuppose the transversality of issues, flows and exchanges involving literary creation and mediation in a single geopraphical area, regardless of linguistic options (Moura, 2017).\nAs an area, post-1945 Europe is largely the result of writing and reading, both from an intrinsic outlook, which brings forward liminalities, urbanities and (trans)border experiences that were forgotten, exhumed or imagined, and from an exotopic point of view in which postcolonial subjects inscribe themselves in the European imaginary by means of migrant, exilic or diasporic experiences. These focus their sight \u201cfrom outside\u201d upon a \u201cprovincialized\u201d (Chakrabarty, 2000) or postcolonialized Europe (Schulze-Engler, 2013), \u201cupsetting it\u201d (idem) by referring to its \u201cpostcoloniality\u201d, or forcing it to face its \u201cpostcolonial melancholy\u201d (Gilroy, 2006) and to (seek to) overcome it.\nEurope, nevertheless, stamped as it is by a complex and often dramatic history, still remains a catalyst for hopes, even for utopias, as we also witness paradoxical phenomena such as the rise of radicalism and religious and ideological extremisms, trends of nationalist and identitary closure, migratory flows and social changes, and evidences of a postnational cosmopolitanism (Dominguez / D\u2019Haen, 2015).\nIn addition to exploring the idea of Europe in contemporary literature, namely insofar as it questions the advantages and weaknesses of an unfinished, ongoing political project like the European Union, it proves equally relevant to examine some trends in the configurations of literary creation and mediation within the space of Europe.

The ludic, ironic and citational nature of contemporary fiction, which puts us into playful dialogue with \u201can external reality that is always already literary and which exists for the sake of the reader\u201d (Demoulin 1997: 11), does not necessarily diminish the pleasure of reading, but rather transforms and complicates it.\nOn the other hand, in an era conspicuously marked by the internet and social media, one notices the development of novel ways of reading, prompted by the appearance of new media, which foster a collaborative approach to writing, new forms of interactivity and sociability and, consequently, different ways of sharing with others the pleasures one derives from books.\nNicolas Ancion identifies different ways of reading literary texts: reading for pleasure, that is, recognizing and recreating the pre-existent and indefinite meaning of the text (criticism, reviews and research), reading as a duty (the academic institution) and reading for fun (the act of reading is more important than what is read, cf. Pennac 1992). Moreover, between pleasure and fun, we find a whole gamut of sensations (states) related to the act of reading and its particular individual and personal modalities, as well as the various reading media which one ought to consider and which may entail an unconfessed or unspeakable kind of reading (Bayard 2007).\nInterlanguage translation, particularly in the European context, as well as intersemiotic and intermedial translation, disseminate and amplify that renewed pleasure of interdisciplinary literary reading, and make possible alternative modes of transmission, navigation and contamination (media, cinema, cartoons, etc.) (M\u00fcller 2006, Badir & Roelens 2007). Especially since the advent of digital media, not only the hedonistic aspect of the literary text is enhanced and redefined but also its intersemiotic, interartistic and interdisciplinary qualities, allowing us to (or even demanding that we) read / see / hear more, and projecting the text out into the world, making it possible to apprehend it in novel ways. As such, reading is tied to new forms of sociability and community, both conventional and digital, fostering the dissemination of reading practices, new forms that generate new and varied relations with literary texts, their authors and the critical-editorial sphere.\u00a0\nIn light of the preceding, we would like to invite researchers with an interest in the pleasures and practices of reading in present-day Europe to make an oral presentation (20 minutes) or propose a workshop (1h30min) about one of the following topics:\nThe pleasures of reading in the European context;National and international policies that seek to promote reading in today\u2019s Europe;Translation and the promotion of reading of/in Europe;Reading differently: digital, intersemiotic and intermedial approaches;Reading across the life span (stages of reading); New communities of readers and forms of sociability.\nProposals (max 250 words) should be sent to ilcleaporto@gmail.com no later than May 15th 2020 (please include \u201cLire2020\u201d in the topic of your email).

Play, in its wide acception and in its nature of artificial and coded mechanism, reflects historically the symbolic work by which human societies have elaborated, explained and organized the world. Play, fiction, representation and human performance are crucial moments in which categories such as reckoning, planning, ability, strategy, but also turbolence, improvisation, discard and change, are concerned. By organizing fictional moments, plays, rituals and collective experiences, humans bet on the meaning of their social groups. In play and representation, as liminal moments, social groups define relationships, roles, functions and identities. Inside representational and fictional performances, 'normal' time is suspended and a new space of experience is defined. Liminal situations produce the possibility of changes, of new and different symbolic experiences.\nBy exploring the nature of play and of fictional moments of representation, this conference aims to shape a deeper look into different aspects of an anthropology of performance. A focus will be put on how different discourses, disciplines and art forms interact in the definition of a dynamics of social representations where human experience can be analyzed and discussed.\nProposals are welcome from different research fields such as Literary Studies, Film Studies, History of Theatre, Psychoanalys, Anthropology, Art History, Philosophy, Historiography and Sociology.\nPapers are invited on topics related, but not limited, to:\nTheatre, historical perspectives on representation, representations in timeCarnivalRituals of remembrance as social representationsRitual forms of representationArt forms as social moments of ritualityMasks and masqueradesCultural history of representationAnthropology of experienceTime, rituality and representationRituals and collectivitySacred representationsRepresentation in society, representation as a social actAnthropology of performance: meaning and social aspects of representationSymbolic meanings in representations\nPaper proposals up to 250 words and a brief biographical note should be sent by\u00a010 June 2020\u00a0to:\u00a0masks@lcir.co.uk.

Whatever the cause may be, statelessness has serious consequences for people affected by it in almost every region of the world.\u00a0\u00a0Earl Warren, late US Supreme Court Justice called Statelessness \u201ca form of punishment more primitive than torture.\u201d\u00a0 Created in a moment in history, statelessness can affect generations to follow if action is not taken for these disenfranchised people.\u00a0 Statelessness, however, can also be resolved in a single moment.\u00a0The # IBelong Campaign of the UNHCR seeks to end statelessness by 2024 although solutions to this daunting issue\u00a0of marginalization and invisibility remain complex and far from fulfilment.

Pell prevented the further deterioration of the fort ruins by installing a fence, a small by powerful act that marks perhaps the first private preservation effort of an 18th-century battlefield site in American history. Throughout 2020 Fort Ticonderoga will be involved in a number of preservation efforts, the restoration of William Ferris Pell\u2019s summer home the Pavilion, stabilization of the reconstructed fort walls, and an historical survey of the Carillon Battlefield. This focus on preserving the past bring us face-to-face with preservation efforts of our predecessors in the 19th and 20th centuries and has prompted the museum to host a conference on the subject of history, preservation, and the creation of memory at historic sites.\nThe Fort Ticonderoga Museum seeks proposals for new research, perspectives, and criticism on the broad history and practice of historic preservation. From an historic or contemporary point of view, what are the practical and philosophical challenges with preservation and restoration? How has the preservation and restoration of historic sites and buildings shaped history, and how will ongoing preservation efforts shape our future understanding of our past? How do monuments, writing, and memory preserve buildings, sites, and individuals that do not survive? What is the interplay between historic landscapes and the built environment? How do we manage our past with our present? How have historic landscapes, structures, and monuments been represented themselves in art, culture, and criticism?\nWe are interested in a wide variety of perspectives engaging a broad range of geographic and temporal examples from the United States and beyond and a range of disciplinary perspectives including, but not limited to, Art History, Architecture, American Studies, Architectural History, Historic Preservation, Memory Studies, Archaeology, Material Culture, and Conservation.\nSessions are 20 minutes in length followed by 10 minutes for audience questions.

As a result, we have seen the emergence of new bodies of researchers working with network analytical methods, such as Social Network Analysis Research in the Middle Ages (SNARMA), and new journals, such as the Journal of Historical Network Research (JHNR). Researchers studying premodern manuscript cultures have been actively engaged with this new methodological trend. Completed and ongoing projects make it clear that the methods of network analysis can be applied to the study of premodern manuscripts and manuscript texts and yield relevant and exciting results. However, it is also clear that scholars of premodern written cultures face unique challenges when engaging with network analysis stemming from the nature of the material they are working with. Not all methods devised by social scientists are applicable to manuscripts and texts, while in other cases, established methods need to be adapted to and reinvented for new needs. Working with large corpora of manuscripts and texts, and approaching premodern written cultures from a quantitative perspective bring their unique challenges to fields that have a long tradition of looking at their subjects in small quantities and with a qualitative lens. As any young methodological subfield, the study of premodern manuscripts and manuscript texts using network analysis is still in an exploratory stage, with theoretical frameworks being forged and methods tested.\nThis conference aims to bring together researchers applying network analysis to premodern manuscripts and manuscript texts. We would like to invite researchers working in all fields of premodern manuscript studies and researchers working with manuscript texts who engage with the methods and concepts stemming from network analysis. Key topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\nWe welcome proposals in two categories: a) 30- minute full papers suitable for presenting completed or ongoing research; and b) 20-minute exploratory papers suitable for presenting newly started research or research proposals that are still being developed. The second category is particularly intended for early career researchers who are new to the field of network analysis and wish to have their ideas tested in front of an expert audience.\nA keynote by Matteo Valleriani (Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin/Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin/University of Tel Aviv) is included on the first day of the conference.\nProposals of between 300 and 500 words should be sent to Dr Evina Steinov\u00e1 at evina.steinova@huygens.knaw.nl by the end of April 2020. Authors of successful submissions will be informed by the end of June 2020 and encouraged to submit full papers in the following months so that they can be circulated in advance to stimulate a fruitful discussion.\nThe language of the conference will be English. We offer to cover the accommodation costs for two nights and provide lunches. We also intend to provide a small number of bursaries to speakers who may need travel assistance.\nFor further information, contact Dr Evina Steinov\u00e1 at evina.steinova@huygens.knaw.nl.\n\n https://www.academia.edu/41856419/Call_for_Papers_Networks_of_Manuscripts_Networks_of_Texts\n\n\n evina.steinova@huygens.knaw.nl\n\n"}, {"title": "Horizons of Engagement", "location": "Belgrade, Serbia", "organization": "Organization: Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-28\r\n                        to 2020-05-30", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-01", "description": "7th International Conference of the Group for Social Engagement Studies\nInstitute for Philosophy and Social Theory, University of Belgrade\nHorizons of Engagement\n28-30 May 2020\nBelgrade\nThe relation between engagement and horizons is fraught with tensions. If we understand engagement as a social practice based on reflection on values, norms and rules of one\u2019s own social reality and horizon as projections and representations of desired reality, it follows that engagement also needs forms of imagination, utopia and fictions. The aim of this conference is to think through this relation and argue that horizons of engagement are constitutive elements of critical thinking of a given social regime and reflection regarding their potential alternative. Furthermore, we argue that such a thought plays a significant role in delegitimizing ossified, well-nigh assumed social structures, fraught with domination, as well as it encourages more or less radical experimentation with existing institutions.\nGiven the polysemy of the relation between horizons and engagement, we aim for contributions that thematize and problematize such a relation. Do horizons signify boundaries of a realized ideal or something that necessarily lies beyond any materialization? Do representations of reality to which we aspire provide an ethical dimension to political projects, projections and anticipations? In other words, does social engagement also have to be ethical, lest politics be reduced to mere calculus? If horizons are something yet to be achieved, does engagement then not assume some form of imagination, utopia, perhaps even fiction?\nOur current political crisis with growing authoritarianism and nationalism in the whole world, urges us to think of different vocabularies and languages as a way to activate old unaccomplished visions that can function in new social circumstances. We seek to create new registers, visions and paths as a way to respond to the pressures of the growing inequalities in the world. The overall ambition of the conference is to present both empirical studies and theoretical inquiries that would contribute to the ongoing discussions on the role of engagement in the 21st century.\nThe crucial questions we would like to place at the heart of this conference are as follows:\n\u00a7\u00a0 Is (social) engagement without a vision possible? What does a good society include, and must visions of it be regulatory determining for actual social practices? Is it sufficient to focus on \u2018concrete\u2019 quotidian questions, avoiding treating social reality as a whole?\n\u00a7\u00a0 Do we need syncretic concepts such as equaliberty (Balibar) and how do they strengthen reflection on values, norms and rules? What ethical premises lie at the foundation of projected horizons and how do they determine and direct social engagement?\n\u00a7\u00a0 Is it possible to create a desired social reality through democratic means of action? Crucially, is a non-violent revolution as a leap toward desired reality possible? What is the connection between various forms of social and governmental order and projections \u2013 does democracy necessarily and always have a role to play?\n\u00a7\u00a0 Are the horizons of engagement necessarily to be found in the past, in already well-worn paths? If this is not the case, what are the attributes of the new register and in what narratives do they manifest? Finally, what new paths are possible today?\n\u00a0\nConfirmed keynote speakers:\nMona Lilja, University of Gothenburg\nAlisse Waterston, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York\n\u00a0\nOrganization of the Conference\nThe Conference is organized by the Group for Social Engagement Studies at the Institute of Philosophy and Social Theory at the University of Belgrade\n\u00a0\nApplication Procedure\nConference applications should be sent via e-mail to the following address ifdt.conference@instifdt.bg.ac.rs no later than March 1st 2020.\n\u00a0\nThe official language of the conference is English.

The Great War was a pivotal event in the development of modernism, and many of our key literary works -\u00a0The Waste Land,\u00a0Mrs. Dalloway,\u00a0Parade's End\u00a0-\u00a0respond in part to the pressures of the war. This influence exceeds the traditional English modernist canon as well, to writers such as Mulk Raj Anand and Tayeb Salih. Literature is just one example of this modernist tendency, which extends to the visual arts, performing arts, and beyond.\nMSA's 2020 theme of Streets intersects productively with a discussion of modernism and the Great War. The physical trenches in which soldiers lived can be thought of as disorienting, squalid streets, and indeed many British trenches were named after roads in London. This troglodyte urban space becomes a violent negative of the streets of the civilian city, and war anxieties on the home front alter the public conception of the spaces that modernism depicts.\nWe welcome proposals for any paper dealing with related issues for a panel at the MSA in Brooklyn (October 22-25, 2020).\u00a0 Please send abstracts of approximately 200 words, along with a brief biographical note, to Matthew Thompson at mrthompson@wustl.edu by March 6, 2020.\n\n mrthompson@wustl.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "Journal of Systems Integration - Data Science topics", "location": "NA", "organization": "Organization: Journal of Systems Integration", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-10\r\n                        to 2020-07-31", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-05", "description": "Call for Papers: Special Issue on Data Science topics (big data, data management, advanced analytics, data architecture, data modeling, etc.)\nThis special issue focuses on the latest and significant contributions on developing and applying data science and advanced analytics.\nSubmissions are invited on all topics of data science and advanced analytics.\nImportant Dates:\nPaper submission due: May 10, 2020First round review notification: June 7, 2020Special issue to be published online: June/July 2020\nSubmission Guidelines:http://www.si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/about/submissions#onlineSubmissions\n\n http://www.si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/index\n\n\n xkars05@vse.cz\n\n"}, {"title": "XI Postgraduate Conference ESGHT/ISCAL 2020 - University of the Algarve", "location": "Faro, Portugal", "organization": "Organization: Universidade do Algarve", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-07-10\r\n                        to 2020-07-10", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-06", "description": "The XI Postgraduate Conference: Management, Hospitality & Tourism is co-organised by the School of Management, Hospitality & Tourism, University of the Algarve, and by the Lisbon Accounting and Business School, Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon, and this tenth edition will take place on 10 July 2020, in Faro.

The new technological possibilities in healthcare not only change patients lives, but also the work of doctors, clinics and companies. This book shows the most up-to-date state of research in the fields of healthcare and medicine worldwide, provides answers to the forms of treatment that are already possible in medicine and illuminates the future possibilities that are already being researched. In addition, today's knowledge is translated and shown how new technologies such as autonomous VR-System can be used for pain reduction as part of a treatment. Finally, this book examines the ethical guidelines in healthcare and medicine that are associated with the rapid development of these technologies.????\n\u00a0\n\n https://www.igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/4616\n\n\n t.musiolik@udk-berlin.de\n\n"}, {"title": "Call for paper - Journal of Global Security and Global Studies ", "location": "Cluj", "organization": "Organization: Organization for Business Development in Society", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-04-01\r\n                        to 2020-04-01", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-15", "description": "The Journal of Global Security and Global Studies invites researchers, academicians, professional, practitioners and scholars to submit their original and extended research to publish in peer reviewed international research journal.\nThe Journal Publishes in both print and online version and it enlists the below area:\nDefense;National security;Political-military;Security strategy;Military strategy;Policies;Self-defense;Strategies and actions of NATO and the EU;Information Society;Future issues of peace and war etc.\n\n https://thesecurityjournal.net/submission/\n\n\n office@thesecurityjournal.net\n\n"}, {"title": "Atmospheric Optics: Aerosols, Visibility, and the Radiative Balance", "location": "Bryce Canyon, UT", "organization": "Organization: Air &amp; Waste Management Association", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-20\r\n                        to 2020-10-23", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-24", "description": "This international conference will provide a technical forum on advances in the scientific understanding of the effects of aerosols on urban, regional, continental, and global-scale haze and the radiative balance.

While mothers tend to be the caregivers of others, who cares about mothers and the work that they do? Do people (including ourselves as mothers), communities, businesses, governments, and other entities empower \u2013 or fail to empower \u2013 mothers? What are the harms of essentialism in this framework? Are there any benefits? How does feminism shape the ways we talk about motherhood?

How do race, class, gender, sexuality, single motherhood, religious beliefs, citizenship, and ableism (among other factors and markers) shape this analysis?\u00a0\nMoreover, as more women have entered paid work and as Baby Boomers require more care, outsourced care and paid carework have become integral in many families. How does outsourced care and paid carework alter the ways that we think about caregiving? How might trickle-down feminism come into play when women outsource childcare and what might the alternatives be? In what ways might capitalism and the changes therein (e.g., austerity measures, proposals for a universal income, the gig economy, national childcare, etc.) help or hinder women individually or as a group? How can we better advocate for mothers and support the work that all caregivers do?\nThis interdisciplinary conference asserts that we need to interrogate our ideologies, cultural practices, work habits, government policies, and family dynamics in order to move toward a better and more just world.

This workshop seeks to explore questions around the legal subject as manifested in its corporate form. The corporation is a legal construct, originally designed to meet social goals. However, throughout the years, and particularly since the rise of neoliberalism in the last decades, it has transformed into an institutional structure that often thwarts human well-being. The recent shift from liberalism to neoliberalism not only repositioned markets and capital, it also reformulated the idealized legal subject at the center of law and politics. Neoliberal legal subjects\u2014both people and the corporations they form\u2014are reconfigured as \u201cunits\u201d of capital that, as such, demand constant investment and management to maximize value. Such units of capital then serve as the mediating institutions through which, according to neoliberalism, social goods are justly allocated and social goals are ideally achieved. How has this profound shift been accomplished? What role has the perception of the corporation, as a legal construct, played in facilitating such transformation? To what extent have laws and polic ies been designed to respond to corporate vulnerability or to the need to support corporations by enhancing their resilience? A central tenet of vulnerability theory is that vulnerability is universal \u2013 for both natural persons and for legal persons (institutional subjects) created by law and policy. Despite this universality, individual and corporate vulnerability are fundamentally different \u2013 individual vulnerability is primary and corporate vulnerability is socially derived. A question can be asked about the ways in which the state chooses to address these universal vulnerabilities \u2013 directly, by focusing on individuals\u2019 resilience, or indirectly, but focusing on corporate resilience. Former French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has been quoted as saying \u201cyes to a market economy, no to a market society.\u201d In a market society, individual vulnerability is addressed not by the state, but by private market actors. And if these actors are tasked to address individual vulnerability, then their resilience becomes a primary concern in the legal/political system. Has corporate vulnerability been permanently elevated above individual vulnerability? Consider the U.S. government\u2019s response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis: efforts went into bailing out corporations, while almost 10 million individual homeowners were left to foreclosure. The regulatory response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, sought to boost corporate resilience by focusing primarily on market actors that, according to this logic, were \u201ctoo-big-to-fail.\u201d The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the act created was highly controversial and has been largely defanged since 2017. The state may recognize the \u201cuniversality and constancy of vulnerability and the need for providing mechanisms for building resilience,\u201d but its efforts have been seeped in an ideological and legal \u201ccult of corporate resilience.\u201d As new political and popular forces gain ground, corporations are proffering evidence, or perhaps just the illusion, of adaptation and evolution. Recently, The Business Roundtable, an association of large businesses concerned primarily with anti-regulatory lobbying, came out with a new \u201cstatement on corporate purpose.\u201dSigned by close to 200 CEOs, it announced that corporations should be managed not solely in the interest of shareholders, but in the interest of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. What are the implications for the individual and the corporation of this explicit acknowledgement that corporations are allowed or even should take individual vulnerability into account? How will corporations do so? Can they do so? If the pursuit of shareholder wealth maximization and economic growth at all costs are the defining characteristics of corporations and their purpose, then are corporations ever capable of compassion, kindness, and an accounting for human wellbeing? This workshop will critically consider the neoliberal corporation, drawing on the analytical tools offered by the vulnerability theory. We welcome papers that utilize the vulnerability theory to interrogate the development of the neoliberal corporation, the values it reflects, and even the recent calls to expect corporations to care for individuals who are not investors. The workshop will allow participants to think through the complex relationships between corporations as legal subjects, legal or state governance of corporate activity, and the hope to achieve goals of social justice within a neoliberal age.\nIssues for Discussion May Include:\nVulnerability and Resilience Background Reading at: http://web.gs.emory.edu/vulnerability/\nSubmissions Procedure: Email a proposal of several paragraphs as a Word or PDF document by February 10th, 2020 to Mangala Kanayson (mkanays@emory.edu).\nDecisions will be made by February 14, 2020 and working paper drafts will be due March 23, 2020 so they can be duplicated and distributed prior to the Workshop.\n\u00a0\n\n http://web.gs.emory.edu/vulnerability/workshops/index.html\n\n\n mkanays@emory.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "Nordisk Arbejderlitteratur VII: Internationale perspektiver og forbindelser", "location": "Arbejdermuseet, K\u00f8benhavn", "organization": "Organization: Nordiskt n\u00e4tverk f\u00f6r arbetarlitteraturforskning", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-09-09\r\n                        to 2020-12-11", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-06-01", "description": "Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8 omtales ofte som den store danske arbejderforfatter. \u00a0Men tager man fx hovedv\u00e6rket Pelle Erobreren(1906-10) \u2013 der nok er et proletarisk modsvar til landsmanden Henrik Pontoppidans Lykke-Per (1898), men ogs\u00e5 st\u00e6rkt inspireret af bl.a.

It\u2019s seen as precarious on the one hand, and technologically over-determined on the other. Economic uncertainty, the rise of the risk society, the culture of fear and neoliberal necropolitics are seen as a serious threat. The risk society attributes all hazards to human decisions; the culture of fear cultivates the tendency to catastrophise; neoliberal necropolitics welds technology to the exploitation of natural and social reserves in an irreversible way. Amidst the general climate of \u2018instrumentarianism\u2019 (Zuboff 2019), paradoxes like \u2018the cancelled future\u2019 (Berardi 2014) or \u2018automated deregulation\u2019 (Steyerl 2019) are synonymous with permanent crisis, disorder, and the 'end of free will' (Han 2017).\nIndeterminacy \u2013 often associated with but not identical to unknowability and liminality \u2013 doesn\u2019t merely defy the \u2018order-disorder\u2019, \u2018certainty-uncertainty\u2019 binary creating a \u2018both-and\u2019 and \u2018neither-nor\u2019 space in which a cat can be both dead and alive, as in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s experiment. Indeterminacy is a self-perpetuating dynamic of change with no spatial or temporal constancy \u2013 a vibrant multiplicity of parallel potentialities and realities. Initially derived from Bohr\u2019s quantum indeterminacy, G\u00f6del's undecidability, and Stengers and Prirogine's non-linear dynamics, indeterminacy upsets stable structures and ossified power regimes which is why it was embraced as a liberating epistemic force by many 20th century artists and theorists: Jarry, Boulez, Cage, Ichinayagi, Situationists International, Xenakis, Fluxus, Knowbotic Research, Derrida, Guattari, Hayles, Varela and Latour, to mention but a few.\nIn the digital age, in accelerated, informational capitalism, the situation is very different. First, permanent change is the rule. Second, art, culture, and (bio)politics are no longer separate; they are fused in the infosphere. Consisting of datification, algorithmic predetermination, cultural production, symbolic and affective regimes, the infosphere has modified the language of thought and action. It has also modified the structure of reality. The aim of this transdisciplinary conference is to evaluate the current and future epistemic and ontological potential of spatio-temporal, cultural-mnemonic and socio-political forms of indeterminacy. To this end, we ask questions such as:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do contemporary digital thinking-making practices articulate the relationship between design and chance, system and impulse, repeatability and irreversibility, rule, iteration and variability?\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How does temporal indeterminacy, as defined by quantum physics, relate to indigenous conceptions of space-time and matter?

The acquired knowledge by virtue of such methods range from the quantification of the level of influence of a node within the network (centrality) to the discovery of shortest paths between a given pair of nodes or the derivation of enriched ways to visualize a network given the weight distribution of its edges.Many of the functionalities that Social Network users enjoy nowadays build upon this algorithmicportfolio, with a late prominence noted around other practical goals (e.g. child abuse or the detection of radicalization risk).Of course, this is only one of the real applications of the field of Graph Mining and Network Analysis, but undoubtedly, is the one that is attracting most of the attention in the current community. This huge and constantly growing amount of works that are currently being published year by year on this topic is a good indicator of the impact that a book focused on this area could have.With all this, the book aims at collecting radically new theoretical insights, reporting recentdevelopments and evincing innovative applications of optimization methods in the areas of data mining and optimization over graphs.\nRecommended Topics\u00a0Graph MiningBio-inspired algorithms over social graph applicationsOptimization over GraphsData Mining and GraphsDiscrete OptimizationSocial Networks and GraphsSwarm IntelligenceBio-inspired algorithms for Network AnalysisEvolutionary and Bio-Inspired ComputationCombinatorial OptimizationEvolutionary algorithms for centrality measures designClustering and community detection based graph miningSocial Network Behaviors, Modeling, and AnalysisCommunity Networks and Impact of evolutionary methodsBio-inspired algorithms for Network Structure Analysis\n\u00a0\nImportant Dates\u00a0February 6, 2020:\u00a0Proposal Submission DeadlineApril 6, 2020:\u00a0Full Chapter SubmissionJune 4, 2020:\u00a0Review Results ReturnedJuly 16, 2020:\u00a0Final Acceptance NotificationJuly 30, 2020:\u00a0Final Chapter Submission\n\n https://www.igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/4461\n\n\n soufiana.mekouar@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Arab Literature in English: Re-writing Gender, Race, Politics and Culture (Conference )", "location": "Coventry, UK.

The term commonly refers to technological urban development with interconnected devices, services, and infrastructure. Some advocates define smart city initiatives as data-driven smart urbanism, while others desire to re-label smart cities as sustainable cities\u00a0to emphasize sustainability as a key design element. Even discussions about designing smart cities as pan cities, which collect data, connect and correlate domains of city services (converted into technological modules with sensors and IOTs), are central to governments' and industries' conversations about the future of urban development with connectivity.\nIn general, advocates intend for smart cities to exhibit the following characteristics:\nNumerous international government driven smart city initiatives are underway to ensure that smart cities are not designed to support technocracies. Cities Coalition for Digital Rights, Barcelona Digital City, Detroit Digital Justice Coalition,\u00a0Seattle Community Technology Advisory Board,\u00a0Amsterdam Tada!, Smart London Board, and\u00a0Smart Dubai AI Ethics Advisory Board\u00a0(Kitchen, 2019)\u00a0are\u00a0major advocates for responsible technology-driven urban development.\nAcademia also has launched initiatives and ethics boards for creating policies to prevent smart cities from becoming AI-enabled surveillance capitalist states, such as \u201cStanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\u00a0and MIT/Harvard's\u00a0Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative), research bodies such as the\u00a0Ada Lovelace Institute, companies (see Google's short-lived\u00a0Advanced Technology External Advisory Council), governments (the\u00a0EU High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence), and stakeholder coalitions (Data for Black Lives\u00a0and\u00a0Partnership on AI)\u201d (Kitchen, 2019).\u00a0The various initiatives reveal great concerns that smart cities may pose a threat to democracy and citizens\u2019 rights to privacy and autonomy.\nSmart city initiatives pose significant questions for higher education:\u00a0What is higher education\u2019s role in ensuring that smart city design and development will create just societies that can minimize the digital divide and differential access? How can higher education support e-governance, smart urban governance, or open governance? How will higher education\u2019s role as the steward of scholarly and credible information change as AI, automation, IOTs, and urban big data\u00a0become the main disseminators and managers of information? Can multidisciplinary educational initiatives collaborate with industries to drive the ethical redevelopment of smart cities?\nConversations regarding the implementation of smart cities are not without controversy; numerous ethical issues can arise due to smart city\u2019s reliance on AI, algorithms, sensors, surveillance systems, and IOTs for its design. Technocracies, technological gentrification, surveillance capitalism, automated racism\u00a0(such as China\u2019s targeted surveillance program and facial recognition tracking of the Uighurs), digital divide, ethics-washing\u00a0(such as Facebook\u2019s ethics report), greenwashing, differential access, hacking, privacy, and data ownership are just some of the issues that can arise from technological urban development. The issues also are the focus of this issue of The\u00a0Liminal journal\u2019s call for papers (CFP).\nIn this volume 1 issue 2 of The Liminal: Interdisciplinary Journal of Technology in Education, we are interested in papers that address the following topics:\nWe welcome both industry leaders and scholars from the disciplines of art, humanities, engineering, design, technology, education, and the sciences to contribute to the Liminal.\n\u00a0\nSherry Jones, Editor-in-Chief\nThe Liminal: Interdisciplinary Journal of Technology in Education\nJournal Website: https://digitalcommons.du.edu/theliminal/\nEmail: theliminaljournal@gmail.com\n\u00a0\nReferencesBass, T., Sutherland, E., & Symons, T.

Studi di cinema e media", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-03-22", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-22", "description": "Media have always been able to configure our sense of space. However, in recent years, technological development\u2014which tends to affect the relationship between the individual and the environment more and more deeply\u2014has been radically intensifying this process. More particularly, the spatial dimension has assumed a role of increasing importance in determining the subject\u2019s activity and agency.\nTwo types of experiences appear particularly interesting in this regard. Those of the first type, which are more immediately relevant to the field of media studies, tend to delocalize the user in non-empirical worlds through the use of immersive devices. Virtual reality\u2014in its varied range of applications and levels of interactivity, ranging from pure contemplation to videoludic interaction\u2014is an effective example of such \u201cheterotopic\u201d spaces.\nThe experiences of the second type, which are only apparently not related to the field of the media, explicitly reconfigure the relationship between the body of the subject and the material space. Transit through urban spaces, frequenting stores and shopping centers, visiting an exhibition or a museum, enjoying tourism and theme parks, mass events or shows, and so on, are today mediated experiences, not only in their content but in their own conditions of existence.\nWhether immersive technologies are used to build simulated worlds or to construct mediatized physical environments, the\u00a0design\u00a0of the space plays a fundamental role. It is a complex operation, to be conceived above all as a process of organization and prefiguration of the interactions between bodies and environments. In particular, such a design: 1) establishes criteria of accessibility of space by organizing and hierarchizing the\u00a0sensory processes; 2)\u00a0orients\u00a0the subject by establishing the range of perspectives and the breadth of fields of interaction; 3) lays out\u00a0plans of action\u00a0through the articulation of space and the distribution of centres of interest; 4) manages the experience by prefiguring\u00a0trajectories, more or less rigidly oriented but nonetheless deployed over time.\nUpon closer look, these operations are in themselves\u00a0narrativeprocedures. In the study of the narrative dimension of media, the narratological perspective has often been privileged. Such a theoretical approach insists especially on the temporal dimension of events, taking as its basis a fundamental distinction between the discursive present of the act of narrating and the past of the narrated actions. Although the representational forms of narrative spaces are frequently investigated, the spatial dimension of storytelling is frequently relegated to a metaphor (\u201cnarrative architecture\u201d, \u201cnarrative structure\u201d, \u201cconceptual map\u201d, etc.).\nA new \u201cnarratopology\u201d applied to environmental media may instead be able, first to describe forms of narrative design of the situated media experience (i.e. grounded in a physical environment), this time in a non-metaphorical sense. Think, for example, of the arrangement of installations in a museum itinerary; or of the functional configuration of a shopping centre; or of the creation of a digital environment. Second, it would be able to identify a different temporal structure, in which the users\u2019 action takes place in the present but interacts with a previously established discursive organization. On this front, the prototype is videogame experience, which is arranged by the game designer and variously implemented by the player; but one can also think, for example, of the design of website navigation.\nThese new narrative architectures accentuate both the\u00a0environmentalization\u00a0of media experience and its\u00a0prefigured\u00a0nature. Consequently, this monographic issue aims to encourage reflection on two unavoidable issues that media studies have progressively highlighted over the past decades: 1) the ecological or \u201cterritorial\u201d logic, which emphasizes the situated and relational aspects of mediation, and in particular the interdependence between subjects and environments; and 2) the logic of\u00a0premediation\u00a0or\u00a0feed-forward, i.e. the prefiguration or anticipatory organization of the physical and mental trajectories of the subjects.\nScholars from all disciplines interested in the narrativity of spaces are invited to send essay proposals aimed at investigating the theme at a theoretical level and/or focusing on specific case studies. The bibliographical references offer some examples of the different theoretical-methodological areas from which the contributions may come. Possible areas of investigation are:\nContributors are invited to send proposals in English or Italian (max. 2000 characters, 5 references, 5 keywords and a short bio) to adriano.daloia@unicampania.it and enrico.carocci@uniroma3.it) by\u00a0March 22, 2020.

An International Philosophical Congress\nJagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, 22-27 September 2020\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the death of the eminent Polish philosopher and humanist Roman Ingarden in 2020 is an occasion to launch an international academic debate on his philosophical legacy. Above all, however, it is a unique opportunity to initiate an international debate on current trends in contemporary philosophy. The main aim of the organisers is therefore to furnish an international group of researchers with a convenient space for a free and creative exchange of thoughts, ideas, and views.\nThe Parliament of the Republic of Poland, convinced of the uniqueness of the work and attitude of the philosopher, established 2020 as the Year of Roman Ingarden.\nThe Congress \u2018Roman Ingarden and Our Times\u2019 will be held 22?27 September 2020 at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\nThe aim of the Congress is to bring together representatives of various fields of philosophy in order to explore contemporary perspectives on ontology, logic, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. The thematic scope of the Congress is not limited to phenomenological issues. The observation of the anniversary of the death of this Polish philosopher constitutes a contribution to the initiation of an international debate on current trends in philosophy.\nTopics may include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 contemporary ontology\n\u00b7 contemporary logic\n\u00b7 contemporary epistemology\n\u00b7 contemporary ethics\n\u00b7 contemporary aesthetics\n\u00b7 cognitive science\n\u00b7 feminist philosophy\n\u00b7 gender studies\n\u00b7 queer studies\n\u00b7 posthuman studies\n\u00b7 the philosophy of Roman Ingarden\nConfirmed Keynote Speakers:\nSusan Haack, University of Miami\nJeff Mitscherling, University of Guelph\nBence Nanay, Univeristy of Antwerp, Univeristy of Cambridge\nPeter Simons, Trinity College Dublin\nAmie Thomasson, Dartmouth College\nDan Zahavi, Univeristy of Copenhagen, Univeristy of Oxford\nSemir Zeki, University College London\nSubmit here: https://ingarden2020.confer.uj.edu.pl/submissions/how-to-submit\n\n https://ingarden2020.confer.uj.edu.pl/submissions\n\n\n ingarden.confer@uj.edu.pl\n\n"}, {"title": "How to Do History and Philosophy of Science with Hans Blumenberg?

Recent work on gleaning has examined the practice of collecting and/or consuming discarded materials in a variety of contexts: spaces of degradation and marginalization, conflict, and ecological catastrophes (Lewis & Rauturier, 2019; Gregson et al, 2010; Hawkins, 2010; Strangleman, 2013).\nIn the context of Middle Ages rural life the right to glean allowed people in need to enter a field to pick up what was left behind after the crop had been harvested. Throughout the 20th century, although at a smaller scale, gleaning continued in agricultural spaces around the world. Today gleaning has been reconfigured as a radical response to consumerism and the global economy.\nBy creatively recirculating what is left at the margins, such practices subvert traditional ideas over conservation and control, systems ordering, classification, and value. They also illuminate contemporary ideas about the mutability of objects as emergences, becomings and assemblages, the over-productive nature of relations (Bataille, 1991), and the presence of the ruined, decayed and abandoned within our everyday geographical imaginaries (De Silvey, 2017).\nWe welcome conceptual as well as empirical contributions that explore how gleaning transgresses the border between commodity and disposal, art and refuse, producer and consumer, from a variety of contexts \u2013 archives and museums, food and agriculture, ecology and waste. Potential themes to address include:\n* How and under what circumstances are gleaning practices mobilised by social movements?\n* What thresholds does gleaning constitute and/or disrupt in contrast to State-led/institutionalised management systems?\n* How collecting practices develop our ideas about waste and re-use\n* How do gleaning practices convert the value-less (that which is lost, discarded and/or fragmented) into something productive, positive and transformative?\n* What are our ethical obligations to the discarded?\nReference ListBataille, G.

The members of the congregation - known as Oratorians - were secular priests living together under a Rule without having taken religious vows. From early on, the Oratorians were in close connection with parishes, serving as clergy and getting involved in apostolate, assistance and education, as well as in the production of art. Later on, numerous Oratorian congregations were established across Europe, as well as in America and Asia. These congregations functioned autonomously, but maintained direct connections between them, forming a kind of confederation; unlike other religious orders, they were not subordinated to a central authority.\u00a0The Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella (Rome) was granted as the headquarters of the first Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri; it was completely renovated soon after, and consecrated in 1577. This church is an artistic masterpiece, having received contributions from some of the most renowned artists and architects from the 16th century onwards. Whilst the Oratorians apparently never developed their own brand of \"artistic style\" - as occurred with other religious institutions -, the fact remains that they sponsored a vast number of works of art, often of considerable significance, forming a corpus that is yet to be studied in due depth.\u00a0We are thus encouraging academic researchers and independent scholars to present their\u00a0paper proposals\u00a0(300 words + a brief biographical sketch of 100 words) for the international conference Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri: Art & Culture, to\u00a0debate on Oratorian art (architecture, painting, sculpture, music, etc.) through all periods and geographical areas.\nThe conference will take place in Lisbon, at the\u00a0Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, between 15 and 17 October 2020, organised by ARTIS - Institute of Art History, School of Arts and Humanities, University of Lisbon.\n\n https://oratorians.weebly.com\n\n\n oratorians@letras.ulisboa.pt\n\n"}, {"title": "Spatial Modernities: Mapping the Physical and Psychological World Symposium (Cmods annual symposium)", "location": "Berrick Saul Buiding", "organization": "Organization: University of York", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-16", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-08", "description": "Spatial Modernities: Mapping the Physical and Psychological World Postgraduate Symposium\u00a0\u00a0Centre for Modern Studies, University of York\n16\u00a0May\u00a02020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKeynote\u00a0Speaker: Professor\u00a0Ian Gregory (Lancaster University)\n\u00a0\nSince the \u2018spatial turn\u2019 in the 1970s, scholars, theorists, scientists, and intellectuals\u00a0across the globe\u00a0have been\u00a0carving out new critical,\u00a0theoretical, and methodological concepts to expand and redefine the scope of\u00a0space.\u00a0Inspired by the fantastic ways that space and modernity interact, scholars have been bringing new experiences and interpretations to understandings of spatial modernity or modern spatiality.

In this instance, the academia across various disciplines has been facing the challenge of turning from post-colonial approaches towards a global and transcultural vision of the world.\nCentral to these scholarly reflections has been the question of how to conceptualize cultural encounters without falling into dichotomous categorizations such as the East/West, centre/periphery, etc. This symposium aims to reflect on and contribute to the methodological lenses introduced by the recent scholarship and is an attempt to develop a critical understanding of the disputed spaces in Eurasia. Simultaneously, it seeks to investigate how boundaries are negotiated, (re-)made, resisted and/or unmade within spaces of cultural (re)production in the contemporary world, where, for instance, a populist wave of nationalist ideologies fuels tensions and conflicts globally.\nBoundaries; aesthetic, ideological, epistemic or physical boundaries that are temporal and spatial compositions and, at the same time, embody (trans-) cultural conceptions of time and space that shape socio-political sensitivities and crises. We encourage participants across different disciplines to present their research and reflect with us on how to open a passage for understanding Boundaries of Here and Now in Eurasian spheres.\nWhere are boundaries located? How do they conceptualize part, present or future?\nHow do individuals, at the micro-level, create and /or participate in the (re)formation of boundaries, and how their acting is connected to the larger transformations at a global level? Furthermore, it is at the centre of our symposium to ask how boundaries are resisted and by whom? Are there ways, visions etc., that attempt to transcend boundaries? These are some of the questions that we would like to address at the symposium.

More obviously, the history of space exploration is closely tied to Cold War military and economic imperatives. Today, established space agencies are struggling with national funding, and numerous countries are starting ambitious space programs, and private companies and individuals are building innovative space plans and technologies. The current socio-political configuration offers thinkers and practitioners new opportunities by which to intervene in how we envision and inhabit the cosmos. Media Theory, Media Fiction, and Infrastructures Beyond the Earth is a two-day workshop May 7-8, 2020 at University of Toronto, Mississauga that will investigate space exploration and inhabitation from the point of view of media studies.\nBecause media infrastructures are outer space\u2019s condition, media scholars and practitioners are uniquely equipped to critically engage with the debates and issues surrounding the anthropological, social and political implications of space exploration. Outer space is a field of activity conditioned by the tools, artifacts, devices, and dispositives of media studies, revealing that humanity\u2019s relationship with the cosmos is a mediated one: we rely on satellites in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) for communication as well as for health and environmental monitoring and planning; on Geo Positioning Satellite (GPS) for navigation; on space travel apparatuses for the development of methods of storage and transportation of information, bodies, and goods; on tele-communication devices for interplanetary transmission; on the tools of media archeology for data sampling; on the tools of media geology for mining and extraction; and on the tools of information sciences for data processing and visualization. Outer space is a site of both potential inhabitation and politics in which medium design plays a crucial role.\nToday, as we face growing concerns about the future of human survival on Earth, we have to rethink our relationship to technology, land, population, property, resource extraction, and environmental management. Even more critically, as space exploration is being envisioned and imagined as a continuation of older logics \u2013 military, colonial, capitalist, sexist, classist, racist, ableist \u2013 we have to ask what kinds of theory, analysis, methods, techniques, and ethics are needed to critically inhabit the cosmos?\nThis workshop will bring together media, information and communication scholars, and students working on outer space and communications infrastructure as well as academics, writers, and thinkers researching science and science fictions, as well as Afrofuturism and Indigenous futures. It will seek to formulate propositions on how media scholars and practitioners can provide noteworthy interventions into the current and future debates around space exploration and inhabitation.\nWe especially welcome proposals from graduate students that propose innovative questions addressing, but not limited to, the following themes:\nWe foresee this event as a collective think tank to reflect on the contribution of media scholars and practitioners to the future of space exploration. We wish to create the conditions for constructive dialogue and collective enunciation.

In this space, this conference seeks to explore the various figurations and conceptions of enslavement and subjection across disciplines\u2014from philosophy to literature, from the arts to the social sciences, to mention only a few\u2014 and beyond territories. Enslavement and subjugation are not only concerns of our past but urgent problems of our present and future. The title of the conference directly refers to Billie Holiday\u2019s 1939 performance of Strange Fruit so as to emphasise both the human and environmental impact of forms of enslavement and subjection which have\u2014literally and metaphorically\u2014left \u201cBlood on the leaves / And blood at the Roots.\u201dThis exploration, as we intend it, takes the form of a reconsideration because we believe that enslavement and subjection need to be continuously \u2018considered again\u2019 and \u2018rethought\u2019 to extend and problematise understandings and approaches to these key themes. Each time we return to these issues, we fix in our mind something that we ought not to forget and we learn something new that we ought not to neglect. In this conference, we would like to reconsider and return on the multiple facets of the problems of enslavement and its evolution in modern forms of subjections, taking with us and keeping in mind the following words:\u00a0\u201c[E]ven as we experienced, recognized, and lived subjection, we did not simply or only live in subjection and as the subjected.\u201d (2016:4)\u00a0In this quote, describing her family\u2019s struggle as Black Americans in the 1950s US, Christina Sharpe\u2019s words and italics highlight an insidious pitfall in methodological approaches to the study of slavery and its legacies in a number of academic disciplines. These approaches are often conducive to a consideration of subjected individuals and communities \u201csimply or only\u201d as \u2018enslaved\u2019 people. These subjected agents become objects of study only as \u2018slaves\u2019 rather than subjects endowed with their own agency, thinking and feelings, and this tendency continues in post-slavery and race studies. Hence, the very attempt to study and understand (post-)slavery and subjection poses the risk of falling back into another type of objectification and dehumanisation of \u2018subjected subjects.\u2019 As for example, Saidiya Hartman notes in relation to archival studies that \u201c[t]he archive dictates what can be said about the past and the kinds of stories that can be told about the persons cataloged, embalmed, and sealed away in box files and folios. To read the archive is to enter a mortuary; it permits one final viewing and allows for a last glimpse of persons about to disappear into the slave hold.\u201d (2007:17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of these words and cognizant of this danger, the conference would like to propose a reconsideration of enslavement and subjection that aims to de-objectify and do justice to the humanity of what we have called the \u2018subjected subjects,\u2019 of the subjects of uneven (hi)stories of a brutally imposed condition, that is not just part of our past, but also continues to have disastrous impacts on our society and environment. Thus, we also aim to further consider the ecological dimension of enslavement and subjugation as tightly knit with the human one, promoting a de-reification of \u2018nature\u2019 and the \u2018natural.\u2019 Thereby our purpose is to illuminate systematic and structural issues of our current climates. The best way to carry out this reconsideration, in our view, is to create a space to listen and to discuss, bringing together diverse contributions across disciplines and institutions, within and without academia. We are convinced that only an inter-and-trans-disciplinary enterprise, which encourages human and intellectual diversity, enables a reconsideration of the problems of enslavement and subjection, as well as of the ways in which we approach these topics. For this reason, we welcome papers both from different fields of study and that tackle the issue of enslavement and subjection at the intersection of different disciplines. This space is not only open to scholars from all over the world, but also to activists and artists who wish to discuss their political engagement with and artistic approaches to the themes.

What does it mean to explore the matter of things at a time when we are threatened with the annihilation of that matter, its disappearance, or its disintegration?\u00a0The second issue of MAST journal seeks to answer and further explore these questions through essays from arts practitioners and theorists.\nQuestions of materiality have been central to both media arts practice and media and communication theory. In most accounts, media is situated as the \u2018inbetween\u2019 of bodies. A sender and a receiver, one and an other, stand at either side of a divide and communicate via a medium. In this sense, media might, following Sybille Kr\u00e4mer\u2019s (2015) reading of Habermas, be considered erotic, connecting material bodies, providing the conditions for the emergence of material assemblages. Of course, media may undertake the opposite role, as Kr\u00e4mer also points out, dividing matter into separate bodies, keeping the sender and receiver at a distance. Media arts practice in the most general sense has been about asking questions about these functions of mediation, which connect, divide and express materialities.\nAnother approach to questions of materiality and media focuses on the matter of media, particularly with respect to the way it may provide the framing for discourse, social relationships and experience in general. Friedrich Kittler (1999) perhaps most famously said that \u2018media determine our situation\u2019, pointing to the impact of technical media on the conditions for discourse in the 20th century. Or as Daniel Miller argues, it is often the invisibility of material objects that give them their power. Miller writes, \u201cobjects are important not because they are evident and physically constrain or enable, but often precisely because we do not \u2018see\u2019 them. The less we are aware of them, the more powerfully they can determine our expectations by setting the scene and ensuring normative behaviour, without being open to challenge\u201d (Miller 5). The field has been grappling with these questions since its inception, and we feel that now, due to intense changes in the political and ecological systems of our planet, the time has come to try and see how we might further these modes of inquiry to address times of crisis. For this second issue, MAST journal is looking for essays from media arts practitioners that theorize, reflect on or otherwise explore their own practice in relation to these themes, as well as essays from media theorists, media philosophers and media archaeologists that address materiality and media art practice.\nIn this issue, we invite essays that address the topic of materiality in relation to our contemporary political, environmental, social or economic state of emergency. We want authors to build on the work already done in the field to see how the materiality of media is implicated in or impacted by the emergence (as etymologically related to emergency) of these conditions. Furthermore, we are interested in receiving essays that address strategies of resistance to dominant paradigms or that offer alternative futures through the lens of materiality. We also welcome essays that conduct a rear-view analysis, exploring the relationship between the materiality of media at other times of crisis.\nWe would welcome diverse responses to the topic of materiality, media and emergency. Topics of interest may include, but are not limited to:\nmateriality and ecological crisismateriality and media art responses to the climate emergencymateriality and miscommunicationsmateriality and waste, pollution and noisethe disappearance/extinction of material thingsmedia and materiality in times of conflictmateriality and displacementthe concept of emergency/emergencemedia archaeology of/in times of crisis\nWe encourage submissions in the below categories:\nfull papers (4000-6000 words)interviews (2000-4000 words)exhibition/book reviews (1000-1500 words)video articles (5-10 min)practice-based studies (media artifacts such as images/video/audio accompanied\u00a0by a 1000-2000 words essay)The last category (practice-based studies) is reserved for studies around media-based artifact(s); in particular, operative media is preferred. Submissions in this category demonstrate a creative media project as the basis of developing research and making a contribution to knowledge in the context of the presented themes in this call.

In 2020 we will host a second conference on the representation of the past in the arts and visual culture. Among the questions to be discussed are: how the visuals art and visual culture produce images of the past, how these images were perceived by the different communities and how they were transformed by the national context of their production.\u00a0\nCurrent study of the visualization of history, the manufacturing of a collective past, rarely deals with the Islamic world, which, during over the last fifty years has been undergoing dramatic social change as new identities are constructed and the past reconsidered.

The conference aims to draw attention in equal measure to small cities, suburban areas, and rural enclaves, a broadened focus that will complement and enrich a field that has long trained its lens on the Italian-American experience in larger urban settings. Addressing this diverse demographic landscape, conference participants are invited to explore questions of materiality; belonging; the processes and products of oral and written family and community histories; labor communities, trajectories, and archaeologies of all kinds; material and digital expressions of these histories, communities, trajectories, and archives. Interventions may see these themes as interpreted through collections housed in historical societies, museums, universities, libraries, archives, homes, private collections, etc., or in virtual or digital forms.\nAll presenters, respondents, and discussants must be members in good standing of the Italian American Studies Association by\u00a0September 1, 2020.\nIASA encourages proposals in diverse formats, including round tables, debates, workshops, teaching sessions, and performances. In addition to individual paper proposals, we encourage the submission of abstracts and/or fully-formed sessions; we also encourage submission of individuals who would prefer to moderate or to comment. If this is your interest, please submit a CV and statement of areas of interest and expertise. We especially encourage interdisciplinary panels and roundtables that provide a structure for creating dialogue at the intersection of creative, social, and humanistic thought, and across diverse disciplinary fields and methodologies. The conference committee will consider proposals that do not specifically address but may complement this year\u2019s conference theme.\nOrganized panels should feature no more than three presenters, (or creative writers or artists, as the case may be) not including the chair and respondent.

Such mobility-aware traces come in huge numbers and very complex forms and can be enriched with multiple different semantic dimensions. These semantically enriched trajectories have the potential to unveil novel challenges in several domains, such as urban, maritime and aviation.\nThe explosion in Data Science is happening now. The Big Data technological infrastructure has reached maturity. Significant interest from the research community is being shown towards the Big Data Value Analytics reference model: data management, data processing, data analytics, data visualization. The time is right for the field of Mobility Data Science to follow the trend!\nOur First Summer School on Data Science for Mobility offers participants both visionary keynote speeches and hands-on mini-courses held by leading experts in AI and Data Analytics for Mobility from Canada, Greece & Italy. The keynotes speeches will explore the challenges faced due to the voluminous and complex mobility data generated every day in maritime and aviation domains. The hands-on mini-courses complement the keynotes by giving practical experience in the usage of analysis tools on real mobility datasets.\nTARGET GROUPSThis Summer School is intended for PhD students, researchers and practitioners in the fields of Computer and Information Science, interested in learning about the most recent developments in mobility data science. Attendees will familiarise themselves with the most recent data science trends, including deep learning and AI methods for mobility data, methods to analyze human mobility as well as with methods for big mobility data.

The area of cross-disciplinary Boredom Studies has been successfully launched and continued to steadily grow over the last two decades. Whatever domain of reality boredom researchers scrutinize, boredom emerges as a significant part of our daily lives.\nIn accordance with previous editions, the 4th International Interdisciplinary Boredom Conference aims to attract specialists on boredom from a wide range of disciplines to expand the knowledge we have already achieved concerning its nature, history, causes, and consequences. The goals of this encounter are to 1) gather together boredom researchers from various academic disciplines worldwide; 2) make new and develop existing connections between them; 3) create the venue for interdisciplinary boredom-oriented academic discussion; 4) promote Boredom Studies as a justified, significant, and needed domain of scientific research; and 5) establish recurrent organizational and social structures that enable further development of Boredom Studies.\nWe look forward to proposals addressing the following areas of interest:\nPhilosophy, Theology and History of BoredomPsychology and Psychiatry of BoredomAnthropology and Sociology of BoredomAnimal BoredomBoredom in Literature and ArtBoredom in Education and Pedagogy\nWe also look forward to the contributions outside above list as we planned to organize an open session.\nPlease, send proposals (in English) of no more than 500 words to josros@ucm.es or mariusz.finkielsztein@gmail.com no later than April 29, 2020.

Mellon Graduate Program in the Digital Humanities, University of Rochester\u00a0\nKeynote: Henry B. Lovejoy, Assistant Professor of History, Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship, University of Colorado Boulder\nDigital technologies have forever altered our understanding of place and space by dividing physical presence from telepresence, birthing the hybrid and sometimes messy field of digital humanities. At the most basic level, email, forums, and social media have enabled lightspeed asynchronous communication, changing the way we live, work, and perform scholarship. Physical places\u2014real, historical, and fictional\u2014can be reconstituted in electronic form and made interactive through the use of augmented or virtual reality, posing new opportunities for experiencing the past and the present alike. Emergent online platforms present new and accessible sites of learning.\nAnd yet, while these real, historical, or fictional spaces may indeed be re-envisioned in other forms, how do we keep in mind the specificities and origins that come with a connectedness to particular physical spaces or locales? Scholars in the fields of feminist, post-colonial, and critical race studies have kept these questions at the forefront of their digital humanities practice. As digital humanities scholars, how do we ensure that, for example, the political and social dimensions of gender, race, sexuality, and class\u2014dimensions that exist in physical space\u2014do not get lost in newly emerging digital forms? While thinking through digital space reveals new modes of experience, such as opportunities for community, accessibility, and activism, we might also consider how digital technologies expand, compress, and transform different spaces in specific ways for specific bodies.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis symposium invites contributions that explore the nature and functions of digital spaces, as well as their connection to the physical world. How does spatial thinking figure into digital projects? How do events and debates in digital spaces transfer to the \u201creal\u201d world, and vice-versa? Is a distinction between analog and digital spaces still valid? Possible topics may include and are by no means limited to:\nWe invite individual submissions on past and ongoing digital humanities projects, as well as theoretical examinations of the above topics. We also welcome pre-constituted panels of 3\u20134 presenters. All submissions should include 300-word abstracts for each 20-minute paper presentation and 100-word bios for each presenter.

The Journal primarily publishes academically rigorous research and reports on current and emerging security and strategic issues.\nThe theme for Volume 3 Issue 1 is \u201cBuilding Strategic Resilience: Managing Uncertainty in an Increasingly Complex World\u201d. The world is being rapidly reshaped by the convergence of scientific and technological advances; the demographic trend towards a more crowded world with an aging population; geopolitical balance of power maneuvers; the continuing rise of the new industrial economies; the resurgence of national and ethnic tensions; social and cultural changes, including the mainstreaming of gender; climate change; increasing pressure on water, energy, land and natural resources; changes in the nature of risk, influence, competition and conflict; and the rapid migration of organized crime, fraud, tax evasion, money-laundering and terrorism into unregulated cyber-space.\nIt is increasingly important to develop strategic resilience. Societal resilience is a complex concept with social, economic and environmental dimensions. It includes core cultural values and beliefs, social stability, the ability of the ecosystem to supply food and water, absorb wastes and other key ecosystem services, and the ability of an economy to continue to generate wealth and employment throughout technological discontinuities, economic restructuring, the loss of uncompetitive businesses and shocks such as a spike in energy prices. The task of building and maintaining resilience therefore includes protecting livelihoods and access to resources, ensuring better protection against aggression, mitigating economic and environmental shocks, building the capacity for rapid recovery, and strengthening the ability to adjust to change. As this suggests, resilience does not mean resisting change, it means maintaining system integrity and output while continuously adjusting to changing circumstances.\nPapers may address any of the associated challenges, including:\na. Managing the implications of resurgent nationalismb. Containing the risk of further nuclear proliferationc. Contending with new models of hybrid warfare and deniable operationsd. Preparing counter-strategies for the growth of cybercrime and the penetration of social media by criminal and terrorist networkse. Building resilience to climate changef. Policing with the community as a strategy for building resilienceg. Improving energy, food and/or water securityh. Redefining economic security (this could include, for example, the implications of AI and robotics for future of employment)i. Containing the risk of pandemics in an increasingly interconnected worldj. The future role of intervention and/or humanitarian assistance and disaster reliefk. The factors that will shape the role and structure of the military in the decades ahead\nSubmissions\nAuthors are invited to prepare articles specifically for this issue of the journal. Previously-written academic papers and conference presentations may also be submitted, provided they are relevant to the theme and have not already been published.\nAll articles will be blind-reviewed by a minimum of two independent experts. Reviews will focus, inter alia, on relevance, citations and whether conclusions are supported by robust, credible and reliable evidence and sound arguments. Please ensure that abstracts and articles are submitted without author information and affiliation.

News, television, social media, celebrity culture, music, and more. As the media and communication sector becomes ever more diverse and dynamic, and we are going to consume it, we also need to understand it.\nToday, the new bio-technical forms of life produced by mainstream digital media and by a whole range of artistic and non-artistic practices confront us with unprecedented theoretical questions, which can be dealt with by combining profound and perplexing perspectives. We need appropriate theoretical frameworks in order to understand the phenomena.\nMedia studies requires the in-depth analysis and criticism. From newspapers, radio and television, to the Internet and mobile technologies, media, communication technologies and information tools impact our daily lives in countless ways. We use them to socialize with others, to seek out or share information and entertainment and to participate in social and cultural debates. But what are media, exactly? How do media institutions and technologies impact the development of society and culture and influence our activities and behaviours?\nIn turn, how do users shape media? What role does the economic structure of media institutions play in shaping our relationship with them? In what ways does the organization and presentation of information influence our understanding of the world and our place in it? How are user-generated forms of media such as social networking sites, blogs, and collaborative informational sources like Wikipedia changing the modern media environment?\nThese are just some of the questions the conference aims to answer. It will also focus on modern communication and information technologies, and try to discover the ways they influence our lives.\nThe conference will bring together speakers from various fields, including mass media, film studies, games industries, political sciences, education, etc., creating closer ties and connections among scholars from different disciplines working on communication\u00a0and media studies.\nPapers are invited on topics related, but not limited, to:\nMedia CulturesCultural representation and power in mediaPolitics of media and media in politicsCensorship, affront and censoriousness in mediaMedia TheoryPsychology of media and communicationsThe idea of the virtualCyberneticsMedia discoursesMedia analyticsMedia Technologies and ProcessesMass media and broadcast media: television, radio, newspapers, magazinesCinema and documentaryTypographic mediaInternet and online mediaSocial mediaMedia BusinessMedia managementIntellectual propertyGlobalization of mediaAdvertising and marketingMedia LiteraciesMedia educationMedia training and workforce developmentPaper proposals up to 250 words and a brief biographical note should be sent by\u00a015 March\u00a02020\u00a0\u00a0to:\u00a0media@lcir.co.uk.\u00a0Please download\u00a0paper proposal form.\nStandard registration fee \u2013 220 GBP \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nStudent registration fee \u2013 180 GBP\nProvisional\u00a0conference venue:\u00a0Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street,\u00a0Bloomsbury, London WC1E 7HX\n\n https://media.lcir.co.uk/\n\n\n media@lcir.co.uk\n\n"}, {"title": "International Conference on Gender Studies: \u201cMapping Gender\u201d (International Conference)", "location": "London, UK", "organization": "Organization: London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-07-11\r\n                        to 2020-07-12", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-20", "description": "International Conference on Gender Studies:\u201cMapping Gender\u201d11-12 July\u00a02020 \u2013 London, UKorganised by\u00a0London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research\u00a0The conference seeks to explore the past and current status of gender identity\u00a0around the world,\u00a0to examine the ways in which society is shaped by gender and to situate gender in relation to the full scope of human affairs.\u00a0Papers are invited on topics related, but not limited, to:\u00a0gender equality\u00a0gender and human rights\u00a0gender and leadership\u00a0gender and health\u00a0gender and sexuality\u00a0gender and religion\u00a0gender and literaturegender and politics\u00a0The conference is addressed to academics, researchers and professionals with a particular interest related to the conference topic.

In his acclaimed study \u2018The Stage Life of Props\u2019 of 2003 Andrew Sofer includes under this term only independent, physical and inanimate objects that are visibly manipulated by an actress or actor over the course of a performance. In this stricter definition of the concept of props the moment of movement plays a central role: objects themselves are not equipped with the potential to move, but they become props as soon as they are integrated into intentional and meaningful representative actions. This definition not only highlights the specific nature of props, but also and above all the way in which props are handled by human actors, which is in turn determined by the connotations and specific construction (functional or otherwise) of each object.\u00a0The conference is dedicated to the props that have been used on the various \u2018stages\u2019 of the visual arts from the Middle Ages to the present. Not only used in the theatre, objects have been staged in the most diverse ways and semantically enriched in Christian liturgy, military triumphal processions and court ceremonies, to name but a few examples. By describing the picture as a window opening on a \u2018historia\u2019, i.e. a scene composed of several figures in different postures and movements, Leon Battista Alberti has assimilated the image space to a stage area, thereby stressing for the first time the parallels between pictorial representations and performances in theatre. Following this, a widening of the view from real to fictional space seems appropriate, in which significant objects can also become props. \u00a0The focus of theatre studies so far has been on existing objects, such as rings, skulls and fans, or artefacts made especially for a theatre production, such as masks, sugar jars or knives with retractable blades. In addition to such objects, which partly have already been the subject of art historical studies, \u2018props\u2019 from the above-mentioned contexts, from private collections or artists\u2019 studios and comparable contexts can also be discussed during the conference. In addition to the staging of such objects in real and fictional spaces, the places where they are stored and presented will also be considered (armories, cabinets of wonder and prop rooms). The methodological approaches to the exploration of props in their relevance to art history or art-historical object studies can also be addressed, such as the theory of affordances and the actor-network theory, both of focus on the specific nature of the objects, or gender-theoretical and transcultural approaches from which new impulses for the analysis of the multi-layered interaction of humans and objects have emerged.\u00a0We look forward to receiving your proposals in German or English.

These institutions that nurtured ideas for centuries in different forms across the world have defined and redefined the world, and means to decipher the reality around them.\u00a0 They are set to defy borders and their existence in parochial forms. In essence, they contest borders in different forms but are at times bound by the political cultures in which they grow and thrive.\nHere the word \u2018border\u2019 can be a contour differentiating regions in their epistemic, systemic, cultural and political structures of knowledge production. These differences are defining characteristics of what emerges out of these knowledge centres. Globalization which opened up borders (read some or selective borders) has by design or default created inequalities and imbalances in knowledge systems. No doubt knowledge is power but the difference in the power that is intrinsic to it and the power ascribed is determined by dominant political and economic hierarchies.\nToday, if we look at the flow of knowledge or movement of scholars from one part of the world to another, there are visible imbalances. If knowledge predominantly flows from global north to global south, people seeking knowledge move from south to north. These imbalances are also seen within these regions, between cultures and communities, one claiming superiority over the other. These realities call for a reassessment of not only what constitutes knowledge, but also what encompasses the idea of borders. It is after this re-examination of the border can the flow of knowledge and knowledge seekers be made even and multidirectional.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this conference, we wish to present a diagnosis of imbalances that exist in the flow of knowledge and mobility of scholars across different borders \u2013 epistemic, systemic, cultural and political and call for a reassessment of cross-border education which we wish to use in place of internationalization of higher education. Our reservation about the term international education also stems from the fact that the notion of nation is largely political in nature whereas, we wish to address borders at different levels, and of different kinds while seeking sans-border education.\nThe objective is to get deeper insights into the way knowledge is perceived, produced and also most importantly the manner in which it flows across borders. From the business of ranking universities to the race for publications, the topic of cross border education is faced with several issues that need closer examination. We also wish to see more elaboration on the inclusive role of education that acts as an equalizer or as a catalyst for creating a level playing field across borders. While the myriad cultures and civilizations have defined knowledge differently, the global imaginary is marred by politics governed by power and hegemony. India-EU Higher Education Meet intends to bring to discussion this politics of knowledge with specific focus on cross-border education.\nSubmission procedure\nYou are invited to submit a brief proposal or an abstract of the paper of 300-500 words. The abstract can also clearly state if the paper would be largely conceptual or supported with empirical evidence.

In a hyper-modern and globalized world, portrayals and interpretations of the human are becoming increasingly concerned with the uses of technology and how they reshape the concepts of human, humanity and humane. This raises the question of whether conscious and rational individuals are aware and empathetic of the negative effects of humanity's actions on the environment and on human nature as a whole. Today, serious humanitarian and environmental crises such as flows of refugees and human displacement as well as the diminishing of natural resources and excessive pollution have a catastrophic effect on the present and future of our planet. We use stories (representations of the past and memories, both personal and collective) not only to make sense of our experiences, but also to justify decisions and to profit from the experience of the past and of others in making resolutions for the present and the future.\nAbstracts for 20-minute papers are welcome.

Its centerpiece was \u2018Aquapolis\u2019, a floating city designed by the leading \u2018metabolist\u2019 architect Kiyonori Kikutake. By the time it closed one year later, Reyner Banham had published\u00a0Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past.\u00a0Paul Virilio had also coined the term\u00a0dromology\u00a0to explain the impact of speed and technology on contemporary culture. For all, speed and technology were not only central to architectural and urban design, but also the mediated culture of spectacle around them. The debates they instigated were not one dimensional however. Virilio\u2019s interest in technology was matched by concerns for social justice. Banham\u2019s focus on megastructures was nuanced by ideas on responsive environments. Kikutake\u2019s interest in \u2018spectacle\u2019 was tied to an interest in ecology as manifest in the 1975 EXPO itself.\nThe event that this conference aligns with, EXPO 2020, addresses the dichotomies found in the work of these theorists. For many, the phenomenon of the EXPO is the epitome of contemporary fast-paced design and development. Commercially driven, built at break neck speed, led by star architects and premised on instant urban planning. EXPO 2020 has all these traits. However, it also presents itself as responsive to social and environmental concerns. It is powered by solar arrays, recycles wastewater and monitors its carbon footprint. It touts its long term plan for housing and mixed-use development post EXPO. It is themed around opportunity, mobility and sustainability. As with the city of Dubai itself \u2013 the poster-child of rapid development in the Gulf \u2013 EXPO 2020 is the perfect backdrop to this conference.\nRapid Cities \u2013 Responsive Architectures\u00a0seeks to examine the dialectic, tensions, problems and possibilities of architecture and urbanism as technologically imbued, fast-paced commercial exercises. Can the design and construction of the built environment be fully profit-driven, remain responsive to climate and cultural heritage? Is spectacle architecture consistent with vernacular design, accessible transport and best practice construction? How do rapidly planned cities ensure social integration, urban health and produce affordable housing? Is it the role of the design and construction industries to respond to these issues at all? Should we embrace speed and technology as motors of design, construction and development as ends in themselves? If we do, what are the advantages and likely results? What does the history of these issues tell us about future trends?\n\n https://architecturemps.com/dubai-2020/\n\n\n events@architecturemps.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Playgrounds for Mothers, Fathers, States and Ideologies", "location": "Romania", "organization": "Organization: Analize - Journal for Gender and Feminist Studies", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-07-31", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-15", "description": "As biological, social, cultural and political experiences, pregnancy, birth, along with all the other experiences that come with the new identities, as (in particular but not only) mothers and fathers - continues to raise\u00a0a\u00a0variety of\u00a0difficult\u00a0questions, debates and contradictory perspectives.

Policies and Practices of Gun Control and the Redefinition of State Prerogatives on the Global Stage, 1890s-1940s18-19 June 2020, University of Padua, Italy\nDeadline for submissions: 15 March 2020Keynote speaker: Prof. Dagmar Ellerbrock (Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden)Concluding remarks: Prof. Stathis Kalyvas (Oxford University)\nFrom the violent tensions of the fin de si\u00e8cle to the troubled institutional postwar reconstructions, from the militarization of society produced by two world wars to the rise of new mass political movements, the series of traumatic events that took place between the 1890s and the 1940s reshaped the relationship between the State and the civilian population dramatically. Limits and norms of State intervention in the private sphere were rewritten by the new necessities of modern societies, which led to a general expansion of the institutions\u2019 claims to regulate the lives of their citizens more strictly.The affirmation \u2013 in theory, if not in praxis \u2013 of the Weberian model of State monopoly on legitimate violence contributed, in a growing process of global integration, to redefine and often enlarge State powers of control, making them as far-reaching and pervasive as ever. The increasing willingness to control on the part of the State resulted \u2013 among other things \u2013 in a generalized reduction in the institutional tolerance for private use of firearms. In this framework, an analysis of the spread, the use and the regulations on private gun ownership can certainly provide a prism through which scholars can gain a more nuanced understanding of those years. Recently, historians have produced a growing body of research on the role of armed violence in societies where the practice and the use of weapons in the private sphere created an unprecedented familiarity with firearms. Yet, private gun ownership \u2013 despite being pivotal in testing the efficacy of State conceptions of monopoly \u2013 rarely, if at all, features in the narrative of the period. Indeed, while gun control is at the center of a highly polarized political and public debate today, its definition as a historical problem \u2013 and its evolution through history \u2013 is still absent in most historiographical reflections on the first half of the twentieth century. The issue of private gun ownership, while often overlooked, can provide additional insight into the institutional, social, and cultural life of the prewar, wartime, interwar and postwar States and societies.This conference seeks to reflect on the relationship existing between private gun ownership and the processes of imposition (or re-imposition) of State legitimacy in peacetime as much as during or in the aftermath of armed conflicts. It intends to do so specifically by addressing how the process of modernization and its ensuing tendency to codification and the world wars and their long shadows have had an impact on three aspects of these processes: institutional regulations on civilian possession of firearms from above; juridical debate on limits and rights of State control; practices and culture of gun ownership on the ground. The event will also consider the reality of private gun ownership in the diverse political experiences that emerged during the interwar period, investigating how both newly-established dictatorships \u2013 especially the ones that ascended to power thanks to the support both practical and ideological of private party militias \u2013, and democratic regimes \u2013 in need of grounding their legitimization through stricter control practices \u2013 dealt with issues concerning gun control among civilian population and the presence of private armed corps in the social sphere. The event stems from the Padua-based projects FARE 2016, \u201cA Fragile Monopoly? Firearms, self-defence, gun licence and the state monopoly of legitimate violence in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (1860-1960)\u201d, and ERC-StG 2015, \u201cThe Dark side of the Belle Epoque. Political Violence and Armed Associations in Europe before the First World War\u201d, which mostly focus on central and western Europe. Although looking at European case-studies with particular attention, a thematic rather than geographic approach is privileged: therefore, the organizers invite scholars, at any stage of their career, to submit their abstract focusing on gun control-related issues set in the Americas, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Oceania, too. Studies highlighting transnational connections in the realm of circulation of ideas, norms and practices are also particularly welcome.The conference will focus on topics such as \u2013 that are not limited to \u2013 the following:\u2013 The development and evolution of government regulations on gun control;\u2013 Experiences of citizen militias and/or private armed police; \u2013 State attitude towards devolution of public policing into the hands of private armed groups; \u2013 Practices and cultures of private gun ownership;\u2013 Juridical conceptions of limits and margins of State monopoly on violence;\u2013 Civilian disarmament in wartime and post-conflict situations and restoration of State authority;\u2013 The history of national or local shooting clubs and their role in spreading gun culture among citizenry;\u2013 Relevant cases of private armed violence and their repercussions on the political debate.\nProposals might also explore related aspects such as:\u2013 Gender relations \u2013 female experiences of gun ownership;\u2013 Firearms as sport \u2013 regulations, institutions and culture;\u2013 Social and cultural relevance of armed self-defence;\u2013 Guns and gun restrictions in popular culture.\nHow to apply:Please submit a 300-word abstract and a brief academic CV at marco.aterrano@unipd.it by 15 March 2020.Funds are available for all selected participants to support travel and lodging expenses.

Exemplary accounts of imaginary happenings and supernatural creatures from a time beyond history and memory explain the genesis of the universe, the making of a living thing, the formation of an attitude or the inception of an institution. The essence of these traditional narratives reflects a certain system of values and code of self-conduct of a group of individuals bound together by social and cultural ties, and the cardinal virtues and vices of human nature captured in a conventional configuration.\nEven though the time and place of performance and reception generate numerous variants and a multitude of interpretations, myths encode a universal sensibility and specificity, and propose generic yet unique models of humanity. They reveal a culture\u2019s deepest understanding of its own beginnings, awareness of purpose and destiny, its position in the world, and meaning of existence and experience. A particular culture creates particular characters to embody its spirit and significant traits of personality, and particular images to convey its most representative attributes and attitudes.\nThe conference aims to explore the mode of organisation, the fundamental patterns and the paradigms of human memory that lie at the root of quintessential stories, tales and beings. It will also focus on the constants and variables of some particular components and their relationship with other fields of study, such as anthropology, arts, cultural history, literature, literary criticism, philosophy, psychology, pedagogy, sociology, theology, etc.\nThe main objective of the event is to bring together all those interested in examining the intersections between their professions and/or interests and some distinct local, regional, national, or global aspects related to myths and mythology, archetypal characters, situations and symbols, providing an integrative approach to their perception and relevance in the 21st\u00a0century.\nTopics include but are not limited to several core issues:\nfrom\u00a0The Age of Fable\u00a0to\u00a0The Golden Bough\u00a0and beyondthe functions and cultural impact of myths, archetypes and symbolsthe locality and universality of myths, archetypes and symbolsmonotheism, polytheism, pantheismgods, demigods and heroesmyth, ritual and the sacredholy books and early writingsmyth-revision from antiquity to the 21st\u00a0centurymythology and languagemythology and sciencemythology and religionmythology and visual artsmythology and musicmass-media and myth creationmythography and mythopesiseuhemerism \u2013 history and imaginationpatterns, prototypes, stereotypesethos and eidosJungian archetypesarchetypal characters in literature and filmarchetypal symbolismarchetypal psychologyarchetypal pedagogysymbols \u2013 context and meaningmajor themes, motifs and symbolsthe meaning and symbolism of coloursthe meaning and symbolism of numberssigns, emblems and iconssemiotics and symbolism\nPaper proposals up to 250 words and a brief biographical note should be sent by\u00a030 April 2020\u00a0to:\u00a0myths@lcir.co.uk.\nPlease download\u00a0paper proposal form.\nRegistration fee \u2013 100 GBP\u00a0 \u00a0\nProvisional conference venue:\u00a0Birkbeck, University of London, 43 Gordon Square,\u00a0London WC1H 0PD\n\n http://myths.lcir.co.uk/\n\n\n info@lcir.co.uk\n\n"}, {"title": "International Conference on Poetry Studies: \u201cPoetry Between Creation and Interpretation\u201c (International Conference)", "location": "Oxford", "organization": "Organization: London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-09-19\r\n                        to 2020-09-19", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-30", "description": "International Conference on Poetry\u00a0Studies:\u201cPoetry Between Creation and Interpretation\u201c19 September 2020 \u2013\u00a0St. Anne\u2019s College, University of Oxford\u00a0organised by\u00a0London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research\u00a0\nPoetry is a constant, being produced by all known civilisations from ancient to modern times. Throughout its extensive history, the individual art of high emotions sublimated into perfect language has approached a vast array of subject matters, including love, war, social issues, the beauty of nature, etc. A particular exercise of the mind and soul, and a unique way of apprehending reality, poetry is a self-sufficient universe that intensifies and enlarges life experience. Pointing to inner knowledge rather than real circumstance, it activates different layers of perception, sweeps away human thoughts, feeds emotions and soothes suffering.\nPoetry inspires as well as instructs, as it is an initiation into the concealed order of the world. Its intense gratification, unrivalled in authenticity and honesty, appeals to human nature and makes ultimate sense of the self, opening the individual to interaction and communication. Poetry ennobles, enlightens and entertains because its expressive boundaries are virtually unlimited. With the help of translation, it goes beyond strict localisation and cultural arbitrariness, generating a sense of spiritual compatibility and communion between the collective identities of the world.\nThe conference aims to bring together international poets, literary critics, translators and scholars from diverse contexts and interdisciplinary fields to share their work.

San Francisco is known for attracting people engaged in exploring the edges in the arts, sciences, and business, as well as in themselves. Here, local groups are experimenting with different pathways to racial and socio-economic healing and new directions in neuroscience, biomedicine, AI, and telehealth \u2013 just to name a few.\nWe invite you to join us in San Francisco, on the edge, as we explore leadership, the ways that we lead, and what we expect from leaders. Leadership can seem, at times, like an empty word. Leaders can accumulate power, aggrandize themselves, and make others suffer as they advance their own interests over those of others. Leaders can also inspire people to act individually and collectively in ways that are kind and that nourish one another and our planet. As leaders and as colleagues committed to leadership scholarship, development, education, and practice, we can influence how leaders move us toward (or away from) a healthy planet and a better world. \u00a0\nCome share your forward-thinking, innovative research and projects! We invite you to bring your experience and knowledge as we ask:\nHOW CAN WE SUPPORT\u00a0leadership for the greater good in business, government, NGOs, and education throughout the globe?\nHOW CAN WE CHANGE\u00a0the conversation on wicked problems like climate change?\u00a0\nHOW CAN WE SHIFT\u00a0public discourse towards listening and respect for each other and all living beings on our planet \u2014 towards championing the rich variety of animals and plants, rather than extinguishing them, and upholding the human rights of all people?\nHOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE\u00a0to the creation and success of regenerative businesses and cultures where we support life, commerce, community, and growth for the next seven generations? \u00a0\nHOW CAN OUR COLLABORATION\u00a0in the trusted space\u00a0of the ILA generate actions, research, and teaching that encourage leaders to create dynamic civil societies and communities with heart and consciousness?\nHOW CAN WE CREATE\u00a0healthy environments in our professional and personal lives that give people confidence and the will to contribute?\u00a0\nILA 2020 will nourish those who lead, consult, teach, study, and conduct research with exciting ideas, innovative projects, and good friends \u2014 both old and new.\nAs you consider submitting, please keep in mind the conference submissions streams: Leading at the Edge; Arts & Leadership; Business Leadership; Ethics & Leadership; Followership; Healthcare Leadership; Indigenous and First Nations Leadership; Leadership Development; Leadership Education; Leadership Scholarship; Peace Leadership; Philosophy, Religion & Worldviews; Public Leadership; Sustainability Leadership; Women & Leadership; Youth Leadership; and Other.\nLearn more about the specialties within each stream and the stream convener(s) in the complete\u00a0Call for Proposals\u00a0then\u00a0Submit Your Proposal\u00a0online by the deadline of February 1, 2020.\u00a0\n\n http://www.ila-net.org/2020global/\n\n\n Global2020CFP@ila-net.org\n\n"}, {"title": "\u201cPolitics and Ethics of eco-documentary\u201d, Traverses, the online journal of film-documentaire.fr", "location": "N/A", "organization": "Organization: www.film-documentaire.fr", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-06-22", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-31", "description": "\u201cPolitics and Ethics of eco-documentary\u201d - Issue 2, Summer 2020\nTRAVERSES is the online journal of www.film-documentaire.fr, a French non-profit website with a very unique database in Europe - more than 50 000 documentary films and 30 000 filmmakers, authors, composers and producers - dedicated to the art of documentary.

Rupi Kaur\u2019s collection Milk and Honey has become an astonishing worldwide publishing phenomenon, but she is only the most high-profile example of a new wave of poets who have bypassed the traditional routes to success. These poets create poetry that is generally short and places heavy emphasis on inspirational messages, and then use various social media platforms, most notably Instagram, to share their work directly with a reading public. Audiences that have traditionally been resistant to literary work have flocked to these writers, and in a few short years this movement \u2013 if indeed it should be classified as a movement \u2013 has become enormously popular. At the same time, the poetry world has seen something of a backlash against these writers, most notably exemplified by Rebecca Watt\u2019s essay \u201cThe Cult of the Noble Amateur\u201d (PN Review, 2018). Instapoetry has also been largely snubbed by academia for several reasons, not least that much of the poetry itself is resistant to formal analysis on account of its simplicity of message and lack of formal innovation. Although some collections of Instapoems have achieved great success, most Instapoetry is ephemeral, never intended to leave the Instagram platform, and writers are often adolescent or even younger, untaught and not widely read. The sheer volume of Instapoetry, too, is daunting: #poetsofinstagram alone links to nearly nine million poems and poetic images. There is little critical consensus on how to deal with poetry that relies as much for impact on the language of visual design and hypertext/hashtagging as it does on the actual text of the poem.\nThis will be the first symposium of its kind devoted to academic discussion of these writings and what their content, appearance and functioning in a digital sharing economy can tell us about the current moment.

Does it benefit the public if certain truths are withheld by the academy\u2019s scholars, or at least, not fully disclosed? When does a distortion actually represent a necessary simplification and when does it become a problematic divergence from the factual base? Does a half-truth always equate to whole lie, or can genuine societal or cultural benefits be gleaned from omissions, misrepresentations or even full-blown falsehoods? Must empirical research always represent a quest for an objective reality, or is misrepresentation of insights in some way advantageous or constructive?

Lisbon)Margarida Medeiros (ICNOVA \u2014 NOVA U. Lisbon)\u00a0\nThroughout the nineteenth century, the camera was believed to be a diabolical machine that could steal human souls. In one of the most notorious texts included in When I Was a Photographer (1899), F\u00e9lix Nadar famously described how Honor\u00e9 de Balzac thought that \u201ceach body in nature is composed of a series of specters\u201d, and that each \u201cDaguerreian operation\u201d would retain one of these spectral layers until the human body of the photographed person amounted to nothing.If on the one hand there was this general idea that photography was a \u201ckilling instrument\u201d, on the other hand it was clear from the beginning that photographs also granted new lives to human beings, animals, objects, etc. Being the \u201cperfect\u201d double of what was once seen in the visible world, the photograph becomes the space where that which is no longer alive can continue to exist. With this in mind, Roland Barthes wrote on his Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (1980) that this relatively new and mostly mechanical art form is responsible for the \u201creturn of the Dead\u201d. Likewise, Susan Sontag (1977) also posited that \u201call photographs are memento mori\u201d.The correlation between photography and death is particularly striking in the last decades of the nineteenth century with the emergence of spirit photography. Through the extensive use of double exposures, William Mumler, William Hope, and others, demonstrated that photography not only dealt with physical reality, but could also place itself within the realms of imagination, magic and illusion.Like photography, cinema has since its beginnings been associated with spectrality. As early as 1896, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s was already directing films such as Le manoir du diable, where editing tricks were used in order to create a supernatural world inhabited by fantastic creatures. At the same time, the supposedly realistic films of brothers Lumi\u00e8re were also being perceived by some spectators as much more than direct and lifelike representations of the world. After watching a Lumi\u00e8re program in 1896, Maxim Gorky famously wrote: \u201cLast night I was in the Kingdom of Shadows [\u2026] It is not life but its shadow, not motion but its soundless spectre\u201d.In the following decades, film critics, film theorists and philosophers as different as Ricciotto Canudo, Jean Epstein, Gilles Deleuze or Jean-Louis Leutrat explored ghostly metaphors in their inquiries on the nature of film. The prime example of this critical tendency occurs in an interview published in the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma (2001), in which Jacques Derrida, almost a decade past the publication of Specters of Marx, characterized cinema as a \u201cspectral technique of apparitions\u201d.In addition, scriptwriters and directors pertaining to different historical and cultural contexts are evidently interested in stories in which the ghostly, the oneiric and the immaterial play a special part.

The full papers (3000-5000 words) are due February 20 (negotiable).\nOriginating from the Latin\u00a0contaminare\u00a0\u201cto touch together,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cdefile,\u201d contamination is commonly framed as the presence of an undesirable element which effectively alters, spoils, harms, or destroys lifeforms, matter or other entities. Beyond thinking in terms of disease or invasion, the scope of globalised capitalist production affords us to consider that we live in a state of ubiquitous contamination. From microplastics to heavy metals, and radioactive compounds, the accumulation of strange molecules in the atmosphere, waters, and land, contribute to climate change and the melting of permafrost \u2013 potentially leading to the release of more greenhouse gases and millennia-old pathogenic viruses. Yet, not only physical materialities are concerned but also the immaterial and intangible, such as digital spam, moods, rumours, or protestor\u2019s demands can become viral. Like microbes and bacteria, computer viruses are trespassers, pervasively moving around the world and seeking to evade detection by filters and border controls.\nWhile contamination assumes the possibility of non-contamination, Alexis Shotwell argues that \u201cwe have never been pure\u201d (2016). Neither, we could add, have we ever been just human. As porous beings, the most part of our bodies constitutes a multiplicity of bacteria, microbes, fungi, and added chemicals. Thus, thinking that we are always already contaminated troubles notions of purity, as well as the stigmatisation of contaminated bodies, objects, or environments. Echoing Anna L. Tsing, without underestimating the real damage caused by environmental pollution, epidemics, and nuclear waste: quarantine is not an option. In her writing about the livelihoods of Matsutake mushrooms, Tsing proposes the alternative approach of \u201ccontamination as collaboration\u201d (2015). She invites us to consider contamination and disturbance more productively and openly, as \u201ctransformation through encounter,\u201d implying that \u201ccontaminated diversity is everywhere,\u201d for better or worse.For this issue, we encourage contributors to think contamination differently from rigid conceptualisations and prefigured connotations, as a concept that travels over neat categories, harbouring the potential of undoing borders, stimulating even \u2018dead\u2019 matter with velocity, and linking together supposedly separate and stagnant beings. This means attending to relationality and difference, on every scale, from molecular frictions to planetary movements. Along this line, contamination is about the in-betweenness, the liminality of the \u2018ish\u2019, the \u2018not quite this or that\u2019 \u2013 the process found in such entanglements. How, then, does thinking with contamination reconfigure conditions of knowing and being? What is at stake, for actors (human and nonhuman) and objects alike, in troubling our understanding of contamination? Who gets to decide what is defined as \u2018toxic\u2019 or \u2018impure\u2019 and what is designated as \u2018clean\u2019?\nWe encourage submissions in the direction of, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n https://soapboxjournal.com\n\n\n info@soapboxjournal.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Reflecting/Reflected Modernity: Sites of Interface between the Occidental and the Oriental", "location": "Humanities Research Centre", "organization": "Organization: University of York", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-03-20", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-02-07", "description": "Reflecting/Reflected Modernity:\u00a0Sites of Interface between the Occidental and the Oriental\nCall for Papers\n\u00a0\n\u2018Modernity\u2019 tends to be used, within the humanities, to refer to something seemingly exclusively Western.

This is particularly important in a lifelong learning culture: to engage and train workforce; discover and develop leaders; and support sharing of knowledge and experience.\n\u00a0\nBy exploiting the latest simulation and visualization technologies, using serious games, we are now able to contextualize the player\u2019s experience in stimulating realistic environments. Furthermore, a large and growing population is increasingly familiar with playing games, which makes them particularly suited as a powerful instructional tool.\n\u00a0\nSerious games should lead to improved learning. We believe that providing evidence of such learning taking place is key to promote the adoption of serious games for education and training amongst healthcare practitioners. There is a growing need for information on in-situ game user assessment. Many are asking how to develop such games and how to apply such games. An effective application of Serious Games for training demands appropriate metrics, analytics, tools, and techniques for in-game user assessment. This can be achieved in particular by measuring elements such as learning outcomes and engagement, considering the twofold nature of Serious Games as compelling games that can also achieve precise learning outcomes.\n\u00a0\nWe believe that this scientific approach is necessary in order to develop a new generation of Serious Games that are able to meet the above mentioned expectations and requirements as more effective training tools.\n\u00a0\nWe are seeking original contributions that advance the state of the art in the technologies and knowledge available to support development and deployment of serious games (SG).

Together, the exhibitions offer an important opportunity to reassess women\u2019s visual and material engagements with the modern as a cultural force in Canada. The social changes effected by modernization brought significant advances for many women: full legal personhood, new careers, the vote, and increasing opportunities for public and artistic leadership. For others, however, modernity brought exclusion and repression. As racialized rhetoric intensified, immigration policy tightened and settlers sought to eliminate Indigenous cultural expression or confine it to the past. Economic transformation endangered pre-industrial ways of life and their attendant cultural forms, but also stimulated new kinds of artistic production.\nHow did the visual and material cultures of Canadian women position them inside and out of the modern? And how does the art that women made turn modernism itself inside-out?\nA rich history of scholarly investigation exists to support this inquiry. In the 1980s and 90s, feminist scholars of European and American art critiqued modernism and the cultural apparatus that supported it, arguing that women had effectively been constituted as modernism\u2019s excluded other. Since then, investigations of anti-modernism as a cultural force in Canada have called attention to the political, linguistic, and economic tensions that led many to search for alternatives. Most recently, studies of multiple modernities and global modernisms have asked us to rethink the boundaries and priorities of a field of study too-long defined by Euro-American exemplars. What new insights emerge when we bring the focalizing lens of Canadian women\u2019s experiences to these discussions?\nThe 4th conference of the Canadian Women Artists History Initiative welcomes papers that respond to this question across all forms of material and visual culture. Case studies and broader analyses are welcome, as are new methodologies for studying un(der)explored Canadian women artists inside and outside of Canada.

This panel seeks proposals from those in: visual arts, music, dance, poetics, interdisciplinary practice, and performance to present current artistic research from practices that intersect with the concept of a reparative turn. In\u00a0Reparative Reading, Paranoid Reading\u00a0(2003) Sedgwick proposed that a critical reparative-based approach offers promising, productive, and undiscovered potential to create individual and social agency that produces a move toward an exit from identity-based bias by reaching for pleasure rather than avoiding shame while also assimilating the violence and trauma that permeates these systems (Sedgwick: 2003; and Best: 2016). A reparative turn offers a constructive action, a re-making-inventing of an empowered-self narrative, an undertaking of a kind of surgery on wounds inflicted by systemic oppression, producing a hopeful exit from othering\u2019s shadows in the context of a creative imaginary engaged with the many possible new existence(s) repair might produce.\u00a0Sedgwick's paper is a call for queer and feminist scholars to consider reparative theory vs. paranoid approaches that currently dominate the fields of liberatory studies.\u00a0This panel seeks to further Sedgwick\u2019s proposal for investment in reparative theory by replacing the suggested reading framework with artistic practice. Specifically, this call seeks contributions foregrounding artistic practices that embody subversive imaginaries in revolt against hegemonic and social othering through a reparative turn towards agency and an exit from dynamics of bias.\u00a0\nThe ASA conference theme \u201cCreativity in Revolt\u201d asks \u201cWhat imaginative and practical possibilities are (simultaneously) opened when people move against seemingly immovable systems of violent domination? How might revolt itself be conceptualized as a creative and artistic form, catalyzing as it actively produces new ways of interacting with what Sylvia Wynter calls the \u201cpraxis of human being?\u201d\u201d (ASA open call)\nBrief guidelines on ASA and the panel format:\u00a0\nAll panel participants are required to be members of ASA in advance of panel proposal submission.

Increasingly influential critical studies on the vegetal world are developed in the works of such authors as Emanuele Coccia, Luce Irigaray, Stefano Mancuso, Michael Marder and others. In his Life of Plants (2018), Coccia argues that plants are quintessentially, radically connected to their surrounding environment: \u201c[The plant] is the most intense, radical, and paradigmatic form of being in the world. To interrogate plants means to understand what it means to be in the world\u201d. In the Renaissance the seed of the plant was considered to be the paradigm of thinking and reason, because reason was defined not strictly as a human agent but as a force capable of fashioning matter (see Coccia 2018). How did early modern philosophers, writers and artists perceive the vegetal world? As germination and growth, blossoming, or even withering were used to illustrate abstract concepts, what visions of the world, life and society were advanced through the metaphorical use of plant\u2019s life? Was the perception of plants conditioned by ideological and theological discourses? Was it shaped by individuals\u2019 senses and emotions? In a period of geographical discoveries, what role did the perception of unknown, exotic plants play in the construction of cultural difference? Moreover: in literary texts, if, for example, Shakespeare is \u2018the poet of Nature\u2019, what can we make of his \u2018invention\u2019 of plants, his use of their real, but also symbolic or metaphorical power, and its imbrications with the human? Do plants anywhere in his texts define the human dimension?\nWe invite invite papers that may offer reappraisals of the representations and/or figural use of plants in early modern texts, be they philosophical, botanical, literary or artistic. Can the interpretation of plants and the use of vegetal figures in some early modern texts allow for a reconsideration of early modern episteme, ideologies, notions about the world and the place of the human in it?\nPapers may discuss, among the others, the following themes:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analogy between plants and humans;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plants and literary genres from an eco-critical perspective: the pastoral, the romance, utopia, emblem-books, country-house poetry, travel narratives, etc.;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eco-critical readings of the use of plants in literary works;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sensory and aesthetic perceptions of the vegetal world in scientific treatises, literary texts and works of art (e.g. paintings, architecture and music);\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early modern \u201cvegetable politics\u201d?

This approach is also connected to the denunciation of arbitrary definitions in terms of class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality in a post-modern society, as well as to any kind of cultural and identity value expressed, not only but also, by pop-culture. In this context, the relevance given to the post-modern deconstruction of narrations and identities, emphasised by many scholars, has led to a plurality of different readings and a multiplicity of discourses.The concept and the role of the prefix \u201cpost-\u201d has been discussed and developed in a huge variety of diverse scenarios of meanings. The Cultural Studies perspective insists on its positive value as producer of knowledge and meaning in a de-centred panorama, as already asserted by Stuart Hall.1 On the other hand, the concept of \u201cpop,\u201d introduced by the work of Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and John Fiske, is more concerned with \u201chow meanings, such as those drawn from popular culture offerings, are interpreted and used in everyday life.\u201d2 The reference is to a culture that comes from the people, but which can, at the same time, influence and intertwine with the so-called \u201chigh-culture.\u201dIn the latter period, indeed also a new perspective on culture has been introduced. The clear-cut division between high and low has started to fade away and a new form of hybrid culture has been born from the interaction of different cultural productions. Intertextuality, multimediality and the influence of the World Wide Web have made this phenomenon possible. The Cultural Studies perspective frees popular culture from ideological constraints by making it a liberating practice in which meaning is not imposed but continually negotiated: \u201cMeaning is constructed \u2013 given produced \u2013 through cultural practices. [\u2026] We map new things in terms of, or by extension or analogy from, things we already know.\u201d3 At the same time, also the current post-modern, post-national, and post-human society is conforming to those practices in order to create new paradigms and forms of cultural exchange and debate.The conference aims at investigating the evolution of English culture and literature in contemporary society through a Cultural Studies perspective. Through the analysis of literary texts, plays, movies, comics, advertisements and commercials, and the depiction of their connections to the global cultural scenario, a picture of the evolution of the English cultural production of the last decades will be proposed.

It was a world characterised by speed and compression of time and space, a world radically different from anything ever known in the past. The exceptional times of national growth and global expansion had a huge impact on the life of the nation and the rapid advances in science and technology facilitated the access to information, which triggered a revolution in the human mind as it increased self-awareness and self-confidence, and stimulated the spirit of (ad)venture.\nOn the other hand, the extreme individualism of the age generated questions, doubts and inner conflicts that nurtured self-indulgence and intemperance. Charles Dickens captured the contradictory nature of the Victorian times in\u00a0A Tale of Two Cities: \u201cIt was the\u00a0best of times, it was the worst of\u00a0times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\u201d\nThe same dual attitude is obvious in the new Millennium, when the economic, social, political, ideological and cultural changes has generated an ethos of individual dispersion and indecisive oscillation between progress and decadence, optimism and depression, hope and cynicism. In Britain, as everywhere else in the world, the schizoid nature of the present has created poles of objectivity and subjectivity that need re-engagement with a specific set of long-lasting values. Thus, the appeal to challenge the current state of affairs by returning to the insular sensitivity, ambition and intelligence forged by the Victorian period is not suprising, as there is an urgent need to reinterpret and reposition its essential concepts and notions from the perspective of the new insular realities.\nAs 2020 marks the 21st\u00a0anniversary of Queen Victoria's birth, the main objective of the conference is to bring together all those interested in exploring the intersections between their professions and/or interests and some distinct aspects of Neo-Victorianism, the aesthetic movement based on the deconstruction and reconstruction of the cultural framework shaped between 1837 and 1901.\nThe event will focus on building and strengthening the dialogue with the past, extending it beyond Queen Victoria's 63 years of reign to the 21st-century aspects of British identity in terms of national loyalty and individual relevance.\nTopics include but are not limited to several core issues:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian principles and practices - continuity and disruption\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Industrial Revolution and individual freedom\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Victorian novel: adaptations and variations\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Dickensian formula of neo-realism\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Victorian Romance\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian poetic emotions\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian anxieties and insecurities\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Victorian Debate: civil society and gender justice\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 women of distinction: reformers, activists, campaigners, environmentalists and Educationalists in the Victorian era and after\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the legacy of Queen Victoria: between potent imperialism and postcolonial nostalgia\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Neo-Victorian ethos: re-visiting Victorian and Edwardian values in the new Millennium\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victoriographies and 21st-century reinterpretations\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Neo)Victorian philosophies: from Utilitarianism to Steampunk\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Neo)Victorian science, technology and religion: idealism and wisdom\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 morals and morality: affections, devotions and abjections\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Neo)Victorian poetry: science and sensibility\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 decadent generations: from Oscar Wilde and Algernon Swinburne to Will Self and Joe Stretch\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 public and private realms: fashion, design and architecture\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 patterns of pastimes and entertainment: the public house, the theatre, the music hall, The circus\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian and Neo-Victorian representations in the arts\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Neo)Victorianism in cinema and television\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian and Neo-Victorian visions of London\nThe conference is addressed to academics, researchers and professionals with a particular interest related to the conference topic.

But this tendency did not mean the turn to the self, but beyond the self, or as Charles Taylor puts it, \u201cto a fragmentation of experience which calls our ordinary notions of identity into question\u201d.\u00a0\nIn his attempts to define the uncanny Freud asserted that it is undoubtedly related to what is frightening \u2013 to what arouses dread and horror.\u00a0It may be something domestic but at the same time unfriendly, dangerous, something that sets the sense of insecurity within the four walls of one\u2019s house. \u201cPersons, things, sense-impressions, experiences and situations which are known and long familiar arouse in us the feeling of danger, fear and even horror. Everyday objects may suddenly lose their familiar side, and become messengers\u201d.\nThe uncanny suggests an unsettling of the feeling of comfort and reassurance in one\u2019s home, but also in oneself. Architecture takes the place of psychology (Kreilkamp). The perturbed relationship between the characters and their familiar world, the troubled sense of home and self-certainty is a result of a traumatic experience of loss.\nIn the new literary and artistic discourse authors tend to depict the new human being, \u201cpsychologically deep and multi-layered, fragmentary, floating on sensation and consciousness, fed by their random thoughts and their half-conscious dream worlds\u201d (Bradbury).\u00a0The new style relies on fragments, breaks, ellipses and disrupted linearity of the narration. It serves to convey the idea of the fractured character of modern time and fragmentariness and allusiveness of subconscious thought. As \u201can externalization of consciousness\u201d, the uncanny becomes a meta-concept for modernity with its disintegration of time, space and self.\nThis conference seeks to explore the representations of the uncanny in language, literature and culture.\u00a0Papers are invited on topics related, but not limited, to:\nuncanny geographies,\nuncanny technologies,\nthe uncanny and visual tropes,\nthe uncanny and gender studies,\nthe uncanny and\u00a0sexuality,\nthe uncanny and postcolonialism.\nThe conference aims to bring together scholars from different fields.

The latter will include roundtable discussions on broader topics, \u201cwildcard roundtables\u201d the topics of which will be decided to create maximum synergies with the festival,\u00a0 and more focused conversations with filmmakers. Through this we hope to take advantage of the current films from all corners of Japanese moving image production showing at the festival, and the large number of filmmakers in attendance.\nPapers / Panels:\nWe encourage submission of papers that point - be it in methodology or topic - to the future of the study of film and moving images from Japan, or the future of film and moving images from Japan themselves. Papers will be ten minutes in length, with the emphasis on leaving ample time for discussion.\nRoundtables / Interviews:\nWe also encourage applications for participation in round table discussions, \u201cwildcard roundtables\u201d that will be coordinated with festival screenings and events, and filmmaker conversations. The \u201cwildcard\u201d events will take on form as the Nippon Connection program becomes clearer, and we hope to use them to further develop ideas on the future of the field or to discuss with attending filmmakers some of the ongoing developments in film in Japan. Each participant in a roundtable will be asked to prepare a very brief statement with thoughts and questions regarding the roundtable theme. To a large degree, these are roundtable that will improvise, explore, and be an opportunity for learning and discussion. See the roundtable topics below - though we also encourage proposing additional topics similar to a panel proposal..\nWe especially seek for graduate students to apply, and encourage drawing on dissertation topics. While obtaining funding for a conference taking place in Germany but organized from the U.S. presents challenges we hope to be able to cover accommodation costs for at least graduate students participating in the conference, and if possible for all participants.\nNippon Connection is one of the best venues in the world to gain an overview of the current state of all corners of moving image production from Japan \u2013 no other festival shows the same number of films or covers the same span of all moving image production in Japan. The festival usually features over 100 films and over 60 filmmakers, though for the 20th edition a higher number of guests than usual are expected. Discounted tickets will be available for conference participants.\nThe conference is open to the public.\u00a0\nFixed roundtable themes:\nProposals:\nPanel papers:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please send abstracts of up to 200 words and a bio (up to\u00a0100 words).\u00a0\nFixed roundtables:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Please send a statement on the future of the study of film\u00a0and moving images from Japan that takes the roundtable theme as its focal point. Consider especially questions of: What are promising directions, how can we consider connected issues in new and more generative ways? What are central issues that need to be highlighted and critiqued more? If you can, include concrete examples. Proposals will have up to 200 words and a bio (up to 100 words).\nWildcard roundtables: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please send a statement of what you find the most\u00a0pressing issue for discussing the future of the study of film and moving images from Japan of up to 200 words and a bio (up to 100 words).\n\u00a0\nNote: It is possible to send in proposals for both a panel paper and for a spot on a roundtable.\nProposal submission: please write \u201cPanel\u201d or \u201cRoundtable\u201d in the subject field and send to: kinemaclub2020@gmail.com\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeadlines:\nPaper proposals: January 30\nRoundtable proposals: January 30\nLine-up Announcement: February 16\n\u00a0\nWe hope to see you there!\nCentral Organizing Committee:\nChika Kinoshita (Kyoto University)\nFabian Wessels (Goethe University Frankfurt)\nAlexander Zahlten (Harvard University)\nWider Organizing Committee:\nMycah Braxton (Harvard University)\nYedong Chen (Harvard University)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat is Kinema Club?\u00a0\nKinema Club is an informal community of scholars, artists, and fans interested in Japanese moving image media established in the early 1990s. Back then we were a small group of like-minded graduate students, frustrated at the lack of community and of bibliographic resources for Japanese film (particularly for work in the language). Each \u201cmember\u201d of this little club xeroxed and swapped the tables of contents for major film journals. When someone new came in, they would go and copy the table of contents for a new journal in return for receiving the core collection. In 1995, bibliography Maureen Donovan (OSU) provided a website and encouraged KC to go digital and see what would come of it. KC established a newsgroup called KineJapan, which instantly grew to 50 names. KineJapan now has over 600 participants from every part of the world.\u00a0\nFrom this description you might gather than Kinema Club is more an idea than a group. The idea is that Kinema Club provides a rubric within which anything is possible. No one owns it. Anyone can take it and do something creative with it. We have no dues (and no budget or bank account). No system of introductions. No office. It is amorphous, even anarchic, but it has definitely played an important role in networking all the scholars, programmers and fans interested in Japanese cinema.\u00a0\nOne of the most important activities has been workshops and conferences. At the end of the 1990s, the study of Japanese cinema was undergoing some interesting transformations. Most notably, it was becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. To confront these changes head-on, a workshop was held at the University of Michigan in 1999. One thing became immediately evident: although there were many students and professors studying Japanese film and television, no one really knew each other. KineJapan already had over 200 members at that point, but few people had met face to face. So subsequent workshops and conferences were held in Hawai\u2019i (2003), NYU (2004), McGill (2004), Tokyo (2005), NYU (2005), Yale (2006), and Frankfurt (2007) and more. The programs for the complete list of conferences are on the archives section of the Kinema Club website: https://kinemaclub.org/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat is Nippon Connection?\nThe Japanese Film Festival Nippon Connection is the largest platform for Japanese cinema worldwide and takes place in Frankfurt a. M., Germany. It screens around 100 films in various programs, as well as a retrospective shown at the German Film Museum, just across the Main river. From the beginning, Nippon Connection has tried to show the most interesting work from every section of moving image production in Japan, including documentary, blockbusters, experimental film, independent film, animation, or TV commercials, Around 17,000 visitors attend the event annually, as well as around 60 directors, actors, and producers from Japan and over 300 accredited professionals. The festival gives out various awards, among them an honor award for achievements in cinema; recent honorees have included Kurosawa Kiyoshi, Terajima Shinobu, or Shinya Tsukamoto. Since the year 2000 the festival has been organized by the non-profit organization Nippon Connection e.V. on a volunteer basis - a very unusual arrangement for a festival of this size.\u00a0\n\n https://kinemaclub.org/\n\n\n kinemaclub2020@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "The 6th World Conference on Women\u2019s Studies 2020 (WCWS 2020)", "location": "Colombo, Western, Sri Lanka", "organization": "Organization: The International Institute of Knowledge Management (TIIKM)", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-28\r\n                        to 2020-05-30", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-21", "description": "WOMEN\u2019S STUDIES CONFERENCE=====================The International Institute of Knowledge Management (TIIKM) takes pride in inviting you to the 6th World Conference on Women\u2019s Studies 2020 (WCWS 2020) to be held from the 28th \u2013 30th May 2020 in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

This year\u2019s conference will interrogate frames of justice, criminality, deviancy, and resistance.\nJacques Derrida states that justice \u201cis that which must not wait.\u201d At the same time, he acknowledges the paradox that justice has yet to arrive: \u201cjustice remains, is yet, to come,\u00a0venir.\u201d In Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail,\u201d King describes the \u201cmyth of time\u201d that society propagates to maintain social, class, and racial hierarchies. The government, media, and public caution marginalized peoples to \u201cbe patient\u201d and \u201cwait\u201d\u2014they say that justice will come in time. Through this spiritual bypassing, society can falsely, but effectively, accuse those fighting for justice as \u201cagitators\u201d and \u201cincendiaries.\u201d The fight for justice thus becomes framed as criminal and deviant behavior. MLK resists this framing in his letter when he urges us to see that \u201c\u2018justice too long delayed is justice denied.\u2019\u201d This tension between justice yet to come and justice that cannot be delayed demonstrates the complicated, variant, and urgent purviews of justice.\nCCC 2020 seeks submissions that explore the broad concepts of \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ccriminality,\u201d or \u201cdeviancy.\u201d Whether it is the media and government\u2019s targeting of civil rights activists in the 1960s, the policing of black, indigenous, poor, and migrant folks, or in the criminalization of LGTBTQ+ identities, \u201cdeviance\u201d is punished by society. Thus, \u201cjustice framed\u201d can mean anything from social justice activism to the ways in which \u201cjustice\u201d is used to advance oppression.\u00a0While the theme asks that we think about the many ways that justice is \u201cframed\u201d (e.g. how it is formulated, how it is repudiated, and how it is abstracted), it also asks that we radically and consciously reimagine what justice could be. For if we take seriously Angela Davis\u2019s assertion that \u201cjustice is indivisible,\u201d then we must also consider her declaration: \u201cYou\u00a0have to\u00a0act as if it were possible to radically transform the world.

Scholars have applied various metaphors to deal with cases when cultural practices, cultural (sub)systems, and cultural phenomena go from one place to another: we are accustomed to hearing of cultural transfers, cultural translations, and cultural contacts. This conference explores yet another concept: cultural migration, which could highlight two aspects of the phenomena to be discussed. On the one hand, to import a cultural product, sometimes a whole context needs to be imported too. It is not enough to translate a drama to the language of a culture that does not have dramas yet. A theatre is also necessary (which means not only a building, but also actors, directors, costumes), an audience (which has some ideas about what is going on when a play is staged), and maybe critics too. It is not enough to write a piece of literature following a foreign generic pattern which has not been cultivated in the given culture: the new genre needs readers who are aware of the pattern. On the other hand, when real people migrate they may bring with them their culture. Cultural contacts are created by real people, usually a large population of them. It is equally interesting whether \u00a0migrant groups try to keep their culture intact in an alien environment and if they manage to create hybrid cultures in the target location. Another possibility is that emigrant groups initiate changes in the home culture. Migratory birds travel to and fro, which may or may not have a cultural parallel: does migration create a cultural route between cultures? In what ways are environment and ecology involved in migrations?\u00a0 When and how does class and alterity come into play?\u00a0 In what ways are patriarchal values involved, and how do current theories about gender and sexuality help shed light on how heritage, memory, and change are involved with cultural migration?\u00a0 What empirical criteria can be used with these kinds of questions, and are there any specific methodologies useful to (perhaps unique to) responding to these kinds of questions? The conference will address these and other questions.\nSubmissions on the following topics are especially welcome:\nCase studies in migration of literary institutions, systems, contexts, genres.Studies in the cultural aspects, consequences, impacts of migration.Migration as a topic of cultural discourse.Cultures of migrationTheoretical errands in a word cloud: migrant, exile, refugee, nomadColonialism, cultural and physical terraforming, and the politics of power and impositionAnthropocene values, xenophobia/ecophobia, and posthumanismTerror and climate change narratives and their impact on narratives and practices of cultural migration\n\n https://sites.psu.edu/culturalmigrations/\n\n\n clsstudies@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Cracow Cognitive Science Conference 2020 - \"Religion and Beliefs\"", "location": "Cracow, Poland", "organization": "Organization: Cognitive Science Student Association and Religious Studies Student Association", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-09\r\n                        to 2020-05-10", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-02-28", "description": "We are honored to invite you to participate in the 12th Cracow Cognitive Science Conference, which will take place on the\u00a09TH AND 10TH OF MAY 2020 IN CRACOW, POLAND.\nThe goal of the conference is to contribute to the development of the interdisciplinary field of Cognitive Science by providing a space to share knowledge among those interested in this field as well as related disciplines.

Exhaustion can be used to describe both the depletion of planetary resources and a structural waning of social and economic equity. Similarly, the burden of exhaustion is increasingly justified by an ideology of resilience and 'mindful' ethical consumerism, even as its effects are carried disproportionately across populations. When it comes to conceptualising sequestration, burnout and extinction, what do these terms tell us about the limitations of the imaginary of exhaustion itself and how are they extrapolated through visual, literary or theoretical modes?\nThis interdisciplinary conference welcomes papers from all disciplines and cross-genre work in the humanities, sciences and at the convergence of art and activism. We are interested in responses to the varied representations of exhaustion, particularly with regard to instrumental and coalitional axes that discern the shape and feel of exhaustion in contemporary life.\nRelated topics include, but are not limited to:- Endurance, waiting and deferral, 'wasting' time (e.g. the 'prosumer');- Affective and immaterial labour e.g. refusal, complaint and 'not doing';- Spectacle, immediacy and disparities of exhaustion between the Global North and Global South;\u2013 Temporalities of extractivism, disaster capitalism and waste;- Decolonial, queer, feminist, accessible and more-than-human futurities;- Hope/lessness, green fatigue, doomsday and apocalypse rhetorics;- Gallows humour, satire and irreverence;- Cultural responses to biodiversity, extinction and ecosystem loss;- Timescales beyond the human, Anthropocene and epochal thinking;- Expendable bodies in the humanities and sciences, disposability and remediation practices;- Mitigation cultures (e.g. climate offsetting) and the financialisation of nature;- Carbon footprints of global art exhibitions/biennales, petrocultures, divestment and the art institution;- Conceptual impasse, absurdity and reaching for other ontological perspectives, the rhetoric of 'why bother';- Neoliberal scales, duration and legacy (e.g. slow scholarship; slacktivism).\nPlease send a 250-word proposal and short biography to the conference organisers.

The Demonstration Track of the Web Conference has become an important venue for sharing cutting-edge and exciting web-based prototype systems with significant research and development efforts. The Demonstrations Track allows researchers and practitioners to demonstrate first-hand visionary systems with innovative features and functionalities in a dedicated session. Submissions must be based on an implemented and tested system that pursues one or more innovative ideas in the interest areas of the conference.\nTopics include (but are not limited to)? Health on the Web? Behavioral analysis and personalization? Crowdsourcing systems and social media? Bio-feedback and emotional computation? New human-computer interfaces? Internet economics, monetization, and online markets? Pervasive Web and mobility? Security, privacy, and trust? Semantics and knowledge? Semantic Web, content analysis, and Web mining? Social networks, social analysis, and computational social science? Web infrastructure: datacenters, cloud computing, and systems? User modeling, personalization, and experience? Mobile, ubiquitous, ambient, and pervasive computation, Web of Things? Web science, Web search, and Web systems\nDemonstrations are encouraged from academic researchers, from industrial practitioners with prototypes or in-production deployments, as well as from any W3C-related activities to interact while exploring the latest techniques for managing web information and knowledge. Software (including games or learning platforms) and hardware demos will be considered equally, provided they show innovative use of Web-based techniques. Each submission must make clear which aspects of the system will be demonstrated, and how. What exactly will the audience experience? What are the interesting scenarios to motivate the demonstration? They should strive to state the significance of the contribution to Web technology or applications. In other words, submissions should describe the intended audience, point out the innovative aspects of the system being demonstrated, and explain how those aspects contribute to the state of the art in the Web and information technology. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the track program committee, who will judge the originality, significance, quality, and clarity of each submission.\nSubmission GuidelinesDemonstration Track submissions must be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings Template and are limited to four pages (including references and appendices). It is the authors\u2019 responsibility to ensure that submissions adhere strictly to the required format. The format cannot be modified with the objective of squeezing in more material. Submissions that do not comply with the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.\nEach demonstration track submission should contain an introduction, brief description, screenshots, value and contribution. Submissions should also indicate how the demonstration will be demonstrated and the hardware requirements (for the organizers).\nSubmissions must be double-blinded.

Each tradition shares with the other a reverence for the same ancient city, but this shared site of veneration also leads to multiple forms of tension and violence, serving as a source of both commonality and conflict between these three traditions. A similar dynamic is visible in the emphasis that Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions place on the religiously envisioned past and future. In common between these three religions is an orientation toward collectively remembered sacred histories, and also toward religious visions of a redemptive future. This shared orientation toward the past and the future, as envisioned within each religious tradition, also serves to both unite and divide.\nThis conference invites selected scholars to gather in Jerusalem to reflect on these related paradigms, exploring how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions of the religiously remembered past and the religiously anticipated future shape understandings of Jerusalem within each tradition. This conference also aims to apply these reflections to an analysis of current views of Jerusalem within diverse religious traditions, through an investigation of how these sacred histories and eschatologies shape the way that Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities understand the significance of the complex and conflicted city of Jerusalem today.\nWe invite scholars to submit paper proposals on this theme. Various methodologies are welcome, including historical, anthropological, theological, and sociological approaches to the study of religion. Preference will be given to papers that exhibit a scholarly expertise in the historical-critical study of Jewish, Christian, or Muslim theological traditions, with attention to related issues in interreligious relations.\nProposals should include an abstract of approximately 300 words, and the professional position held by the author. Please submit the proposals by email, in attachment in Word or PDF, to both Dr. Emma Polyakov (polyakove@merrimack.edu) and Dr. Maria Lepp\u00e4kari (maria.leppakari@svenskakyrkan.se). Proposals are due by January 6, 2020.\n\u00a0\nConference Details\nThis conference will be held in an academic roundtable format, to foster an environment conducive to substantive and in-depth discussion of the papers. During the four days of the conference, participants will present papers and engage in discussion, with time set aside to visit Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sacred sites in Jerusalem. The Swedish Theological Institute, located in the historic and beautiful Beit Tabor house in West Jerusalem, serves as the conference venue. For authors of the selected paper proposals, accommodation and the conference fee will covered by the generous support of the Swedish Theological Institute.\nFollowing the conference, revised versions of the conference papers will be reviewed for inclusion in an edited volume.\nThis conference is a joint project of the Swedish Theological Institute, the Center for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations, and the Department of Religious and Theological Studies at Merrimack College.\n\u00a0\nConference Director: Dr. Emma Polyakov, Assistant Professor of Religious Studies, Merrimack College, polyakove@merrimack.edu\n\u00a0\nDirector of the Swedish Theological Institute: Rev.\u00a0Dr. Maria Lepp\u00e4kari, maria.leppakari@svenskakyrkan.se\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSwedish Theological Institute: http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/sti\nCenter for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations: https://www.merrimack.edu/academics/centers/jcmr/\nDepartment of Religious and Theological Studies at Merrimack College: https://www.merrimack.edu/academics/liberal_arts/religious_theological_studies/\n\n polyakove@merrimack.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "The International Conference on Sustainable Futures: Environmental, Technological, Social and Economic Matters (ICSF-2020)", "location": "Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine", "organization": "Organization: Kryvyi Rih National University", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-20\r\n                        to 2020-05-22", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2019-12-31", "description": "The International Conference on Sustainable Futures: Environmental, Technological, Social and Economic Matters (ICSF) is a peer-reviewed international conference, which is the premier interdisciplinary forum for social scientists, life scientists, engineers, and practitioners to present their latest research results, ideas, developments, and applications.\nThe ICSF occupies contributions in all aspects of sustainable development, focused on the intersection of sustainability, environment and technology, and their larger implications for corporation, government, education institutions, regions and society both at present and in the future.\nWe invite you to participate in the conference and look forward to fruitful cooperation.\nList of Topics*\nCorporate Sustainability and Corporate Social ResponsibilityEnergy for Sustainable DevelopmentGeotechnical and Geoenvironmental EngineeringGovernance, Legislation and Policy for SustainabilityMeasuring, Forecasting and Monitoring SustainabilitySocial and Cultural SustainabilitySustainable Building and ArchitectureSustainable Cities and SocietySustainable ComputingSustainable EconomySustainable EducationSustainable EnergySustainable Environment and Environmental ManagementSustainable Materials and TechnologiesSustainable MiningSustainable TourismSustainable Transport\n* ICSF focus, but are not limited to the listed topics\nSubmission Guidelines\nAuthors are invited to submit full (and original research) papers (6-12 pages) including surveys, tutorials, perspective/colloquia articles in conference topics of interest through the EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsf2020) by December 31, 2019.\nSubmitted papers will be peer-reviewed by three reviewers on the basis of technical quality, relevance, originality, significance, and clarity.

Then I have stood on the peaky mountain wrapped in rainbows, with a harp and a sword in my hands.\u201d- Dust Tracks on a Road, Zora Neale Hurston.\nHurston\u2019s words, pinned in her 1942 autobiography, still ring true for many today, the reality that life consists of highs and lows of the human experience. As an anthropologist, ethnographer, recorder, and re-creator of community, Hurston documents the holistic lives of African-Americans, reaping the benefits of the Post-Reconstruction Era, which yielded both new possibilities for the former slave and the reality of Jim Crow and systematic disenfranchisement. Hurston refuses to abandon these communities that represent great fortitude, knowledge, and resiliency.\nThis conference seeks to explore the idea of community through various perspectives and disciplines. Philosopher, Roberto Esposito states, \u201cCommunity isn\u2019t a property, nor is it a territory to be separated and defended against those who do not belong to it. Rather, it is a void, a debt, a gift to the other that also reminds us of our constitutive alterity with respect to ourselves\u201d (21). Esposito\u2019s definition of community challenges many to reconsider the ways in which individuals view or perceive others and how they include or exclude others from accessing power and utilizing resources in a geographical area. Therefore, ZoraFest invites rich, academic, and relevant discussions regarding a wide-range of themes, concepts, and ideas of community - as they relate to Hurston\u2019s vast repertoire of work, history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, economics, the development, maintenance, and growth of marginalized communities.\u00a0\nAbstract Instructions:\nPlease provide an abstract/brief summary of your paper and your whole project.

However, it has seen revived interest outside the academy. Since 2017, Vergil\u2019s epic has featured in articles in the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New Yorker. All three articles argue that the Aeneid speaks as much to modernity as it does to antiquity.\u00a0Mendelsohn\u2019s New Yorker piece put it best, writing,\n\u00a0\nAeneas [is] . . . a survivor, a person so fractured by the horrors of the past that he can hold himself together only by an unnatural effort of will, someone who has so little of his history left that the only thing that gets him through the present is a numbed sense of duty to a barely discernible future that can justify every kind of deprivation. It would be hard to think of a more modern figure. Or, indeed, a more modern story.\n\u00a0\nNearly every review of various recent translations provides an impassioned reaffirmation of the epic\u2019s contemporary relevance. However, scholarly practice has trailed behind scholarly rhetoric in this regard. For example, in demonstrating the modern importance of Vergil\u2019s classic, a number of reviews from the late 2000s briefly stress the similarities between Vergil and Kipling\u2019s views of empire. As the government sanctioned poets of global empires, one might expect to find thorough comparisons between Kipling and Vergil in the literature. Remarkably, one would find several articles devoted to historical inquiry into the quality of Kipling\u2019s classical education, but none directly considering the relationship between those classics and his own writing.\n\u00a0\nThe gap between the general claims of the Aeneid\u2019s relevance and a rigorous working out of the details is initially startling. After all, the Aeneid hardly lacks for excellent scholarship and commentary. However, upon reflection the lacuna is unsurprising. Scholarship on the Aeneid typically comes from classicists focused on the text\u2019s language and poetics, and its historical and cultural contexts. It is treated as an explicitly Roman cultural artifact. Since classicists are in part historians, a natural direction to expand their work on the Aeneid is to consider its reception in other historical epochs. This is precisely what we see in, e.g., Hardie\u2019s impressive work in cataloging centuries worth of use and misuse of the epic, and Farrell and Putnam\u2019s discussion of modern criticism of and response to the Aeneid. However, these historical methods, as important and useful as they are, won\u2019t suffice to examine the modern significance of the text. That requires a thoroughly interdisciplinary approach.\n\u00a0\nWe propose a volume of essays from a diverse group of scholars and artists that represents a multidisciplinary, multicultural redeployment of the Aeneid. We do not propose examining the Aeneid as a decidedly Roman text. Nor do we propose an examination of a cultural artifact. Rather, we seek to present a volume that deploys the Aeneid anew, one that not only reflects the Aeneid\u2019s status as a \u2018modern story\u2019 (Mendelsohn, loc. cit.), but one that inserts the Aeneid into contemporary discourse. We understand \u2018contemporary\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 rather broadly\u2014essays need not be limited strictly to the new millennium. Papers that address, for example, the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge, or the Rwandan genocide, would certainly be welcome.\n\u00a0\nWe invite submissions that engage with the aforementioned issues or related ones regarding the Aeneid, including the following:\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Artistic and cultural appropriation and reclamation, especially from a post-colonial perspective\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using the Aeneid to explore constructions of gender\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Representations of trauma and its effects\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Aeneid as therapy\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Aeneid and modern commemorations\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The representation/literature/philosophy/theorizing of immigrants, immigration, refugees, cosmopolitanism, and global justice\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Race and ethnicity in the Aeneid\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using the Aeneid to negotiate difference\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How the Aeneid complicates, or enriches modern (broadly construed) texts, art works, etc. (such as an analysis of the Aeneid and other later artworks of empire)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Aeneid as symbol and its function as a mine for cultural signposts, etc.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Aeneid and pedagogy\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Aeneid in the public and/or digital humanities\n\u00a0\nFinal papers should run between 4,000\u20136,000 words (inclusive of endnotes and works cited) and be formatted according to Chicago Manual of Style (17th Edition).

What performance was required from a Justice of the Peace to arrest their neighbour? And how did popular drama\u2019s use of common processes of authority like these contribute to or alter their meaning?\nThis symposium aims to bring together researchers from English, history, political thought and performance studies, in order to probe some of these questions. It builds from recent currents in early modern history, considering the lived experience of government, and the state as social actor, and from the increased interest in the modalities of performance in early modern literary studies. It hopes to foster discussion across disciplinary boundaries, to explore different ways of approaching the ways that authority was performed in ordinary life, and to offer a new approach to social and legal history.\nThe symposium\u2019s structure is distinctively interdisciplinary, and designed to provoke conversation between researchers. It will begin with a pair of keynote presentations, by Dr Clare Egan (English, Lancaster) and Dr Hillary Taylor (History, Jesus College Cambridge). There will then be a panel of three to four speakers from a variety of disciplines. The symposium will culminate in a practice as research workshop led by History DPhil Lucy Clarke, in which actors will experiment with staging proclamations and arrests, and in which attendees are encouraged to participate in discussion.\nApplications are open for three or four 15-20 minute papers. We encourage graduate students and ECRs in particular to apply, irrespective of faculty.

Photographs of sport, and of its most popular athletes, have long been essential not only to sports reporting but also to the commercial exploitation of professional sport as a form of spectacle and entertainment. Just as sport itself is open to a wide range of symbolic and political interpretations, certain sports photographs have transcended the ephemeral nature of daily reports to enter the popular imagination and collective memory. Equally, private photographs of junior and grassroots sport are increasingly valued as part of sporting heritage. Even in the age of television and the internet, the still photograph remains an essential element of sport as a cultural phenomenon.\nYet, as Mike O\u2019Mahony observes in Photography and Sport (Reaktion, 2018), definitions of \u2018sports photography\u2019 have tended to be narrow, and the history of photographs of sport has only recently begun to receive the academic attention accorded to other photographic genres. Only rarely are sports photographs taken seriously in their own right. \u2018Photographs taken during key sporting events [\u2026] are assumed [\u2026] to derive their value and meaning from an awareness of the event rather than the intrinsic values of the image itself\u2019 (O\u2019Mahony 11).\nThis colloquium aims to contribute to an ongoing process of challenging these assumptions through scholarly and critical engagement with the relationship between photography and sport. We invite proposals for 20-minute papers on neglected or original aspects of this relationship, and welcome approaches that take an historical, theoretical or practical approach. Transnational and comparative approaches are very welcome.

The Colloquium will be held at Maxwell Chambers Suites on 19 May 2020 and aims to be a platform for legal practitioners, emerging scholars, industry experts and students to contribute to developing thought leadership in topics relating to the ethical and regulatory challenges arising from technology\u2019s impact on the legal profession. \u00a0\nThe Colloquium will comprise of four thematic panel sessions. We welcome submissions of proposals on any of the following themes:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal Ethics & Technology: The proliferation of technology has meant that today\u2019s lawyers can no longer afford to remain inexperienced or unaware of technology and its developments. For one, the American Bar Association has recommended an ethical duty of technological competence in its model code of conduct for lawyers. However, technology also presents a host of ethical challenges for which there are few legal guidelines or rules. For example, how should lawyers ensure that the use of technology does not compromise their ethical obligations? Should lawyers be permitted to delegate the exercise of their independent professional judgment to technology? We will consider how technology will have an impact on lawyers\u2019 ethical duties, and vice versa.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Role of Lawyers in the Age of Disruption: Disruption is unavoidable in this \u201cnew age\u201d of the legal profession and requires a re-evaluation of the role of the legal practitioner. We will examine the ways in which disruption in its various forms (e.g. artificial intelligence, online dispute resolution) may aid or hinder the role of lawyers, and consider whether and how the role of lawyers should be reinvented so that legal professionals can remain trusted advisors to their clients.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Law Practices and the Future of Work: What will the future of legal work look like? Are current law practice structures and infrastructure adequate to meet the challenges posed by, for example, non-lawyers who may be permitted to carry out legal work? Should virtual law practices co-exist with conventional law practices in the future? We will examine whether, and the extent to which, non-traditional law practice structures and infrastructure are useful for the legal profession.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alternative Legal Service Providers \u2013 To Regulate or Not to Regulate?: The emergence of new players in the legal profession \u2013 in the form of alternative legal service providers or ALSPs \u2013 has brought about a rethinking of the traditional legal service delivery model. While ALSPs leverage technology to offer efficient, easier access to, and more cost-effective legal assistance and solutions to consumers, they also present new regulatory challenges that have yet to be adequately addressed or even considered. We will examine and where appropriate, propose new approaches to addressing these challenges to ensure that new models of legal services delivery remain rooted in the core values of the legal profession, which include protecting the public, ensuring access to justice, and upholding the rule of law.\nProposal Submission Procedure\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested participants may submit proposals for their paper as an abstract of between 150-300 words along with the following information:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Full name\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Name of Law Practice/Institution/Organisation\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Details\nAbstracts and participants\u2019 information should be submitted via e-mail to the Legal Research and Development department at lrd@lawsoc.org.sg.

Childhood, like gender and race, is viewed as a socially constructed category that falls between or at two poles. First, as a matter of biological reality\u2014where childhood is the initial evolutionary stage\u2014and second, as an idea that serves to subordinate those designated as child-like to the \u201cmature\u201d world of adults. Childhood continues to be a social reality with an apparently universal, or at least extensive, role in everything human. This year we ask one broad question: how do ideas, experiences, narratives, memories, media representations and imaginations of childhood constitute religious worlds, and how do religious worlds render the former meaningful? Be it Buddha\u2019s early exposure to a morbid world, baby-Krishna\u2019s playful tales, Sunday schools, bed-time stories on what growing up entails, birthing rituals or paternalistic conceptions of the \u2018secular\u2019 state--we want to showcase graduate work that explores the broad themes of childhood and religion vis-\u00e0-vis one another. The 2020 Graduate Student Conference of the Department of Religion at Columbia University invites papers that address childhood\u2019s imbrication with specific religions, and/or the religious, hoping that doing so will rely on and illuminate the study of other important social realities.

The domination and deprivation associated with inequalities have also constituted an inexhaustible source for sociological knowledge, from its early foundation days as a social science to the latest indictments of critical sociology.\nSimultaneously, we also observe contrasting social dynamics that are anchored in the defence of respect for differences, materializing in struggles for cultural and/or identity recognition. Here, an accumulated sociological legacy has also contributed to the knowledge and understanding of the complex logics underlying the social production of itself and its modes of belonging.\nToday, the issues surrounding identities are an effervescent topic, for reasons which don\u2019t always coincide. On one hand, increasing legitimacy is given to experiences and paths that were once silenced and made invisible, and which now seek to gain and exercise the right to speak of themselves, on their own terms, in the public sphere. On the other hand, we witness a resurgence of incommunicating differences and exclusion, evidencing that history is not teleological or a one-way route, as crossroads and bifurcations appear in it, prompting regressions that present themselves as increasingly popular and miraculous solutions.\nThe fine analysis of the social anchoring of the production of identities allows us to reveal how ways of acting, thinking, and feeling are forged, through the different social interactions, in accordance with the weights and counterweights of class, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age... It also motivates the need to overcome a current of thought that is lacking and averse to complexity, transits, and intermittences, usually expressed through artificial binary pairs, demanding mediation between the intricate and plural social folds.\nIt is important to determine the extent to which, in practice, a communicating multivocality \u2013 that is, a universal culture of recognition and translation of differences, of coexistence among equals \u2013 and its representatives and protagonists exist, since only difference creates relations, only it allows, by a shared singularity, to find bridges and build communities. To this end, it is crucial to incorporate the practical awareness of intersectionality and the modalities and metamorphoses through which, as Nancy Frazer proposes, economic, cultural, and political injustices intersect, combining the need for policies of redistribution, recognition of difference, and representation.\nIn parallel, we witness the reactivation of realist identities, based on ideologies of purity and firmly rooted in beliefs of social closure. Some of these movements openly proselytize exclusion and hatred, often resorting to violence, and have gained increasing support, to the point of colonizing state institutions, political parties, and respected international bodies, nourished by the social vulnerability of growing social fringes.\nBoth tendencies \u2013 emancipatory and of domination \u2013 today shape the processes of globalization and invite the study and debate of their differences, as well as their overlapping areas.\nTo discover the configurations of contemporary identity processes, in their confrontations and complexity, is the goal of the XI Portuguese Congress of Sociology, titled Heated identities: differences, belonging, and populisms in an effervescent world, which will be held in Lisbon, June 29 through July 1, 2020, under the local organization of ESPP/ISCTE-IUL and ICS-ULisboa.\n\n https://xi-congresso-aps.eventqualia.net/en/2020/home/\n\n\n congresso-aps@eventqualia.net\n\n"}, {"title": "Many Regimes of Capital in the Postdigital Age", "location": "Warsaw, Poland", "organization": "Organization: Techno-Humanities Lab", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-05-21\r\n                        to 2020-05-22", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-04-05", "description": "Call for Papers \nMANY REGIMES OF CAPITAL IN THE POSTDIGITAL AGE\nFaculty of \u201cArtes Liberales\u201d at the University of Warsaw 21-22 May 2020\n\u00a0\nPapers and panels are invited for an interdisciplinary conference Many Regimes of Capital in The Postdigital Age, which will take place in Warsaw, 21-22 May 2020. The conference is organized by the Faculty of \u201cArtes Liberales\u201d at the University of Warsaw (Poland) in collaboration with the Center for Philosophical Technologies at Arizona State University. This conference is part of the project Technology and Socialization.\n\u00a0\nConfirmed keynote speakers include:\n\u00a0\nGregg Lambert\n(Dean\u2019s Professor of Humanities, Principal Investigator, The CNY Humanities Corridor, Humanities Center, Syracuse University)\n\u00a0\nAdam Nocek\n(Professor in the School of Arts, Media, and Engineering and the Design School, Arizona State University)\n\u00a0\nKiarina Kordela(Professor of German Studies and Director of the Critical Theory Program, at Macalester College, St. Paul, Minnesota)\n\u00a0\nCapitalism today is gaining new meaning and looking for a new name and new theorethical and practical approaches. In recent decades, philosophers and critical theorists have taken to reconceptualizing the many appearances of Capital: from cognitive, affective, and neoliberal capitalism to computational, necro-, anarcho-, and surveillance-capitalism. These are just several of the ways to name an era marked by the capitalization of nearly everything\u2014work, attention, affect, and even life itself. Along with these attempts to characterize our epoch, new modes of resistance have also been imagined: from alternative modalities of negation and accelerationist pleas for Promeathan transformations of the logic of production to new forms of immanent resistance through situated counter-conduct.\nThis conference wishes to address not only the varieties of capitalist production today but also whether and to what extent the different manifestations of capitalism are only different types of capital. In other words, is mental and emotional health a commodity in the same sense as the products of our hands and brains are commodities? Does capital therefore have an essence with many different appearances\u2014as suggested, for example, by MacKenzie Wark in Capital is Dead. Is This Something Worse? (2019)? And if capitalism does have an essence, then is it reducible to the permanent expansion of economic transactions to every domain of human and nonhuman activity?\nThis conference wishes to draw on a wide range of voices\u2014from philosophy and critical theory to experimental arts and design\u2014 to interrogate, critique, and reimagine the many regimes of capitalist and post-capitalist production today and in the future.\nProposals are welcome on, but not limited to, the following topics:\nWhat are the differences between the various regimes of capital? Do we find the difference between the model of production (used technology, type of work, division of work, etc.), the regime of accumulation (system of dividing the value into wages, investments, savings, insurance) and the system of regulation of a given capital in these different regimes?What is the relationship between \u201cemotional capital\u201d and \u201ccognitive capital\u201d? How do cognitive, affective and symbolic elements of capital relate to each-other? Does each type of capital develop specific new accumulation mechanisms? What is the accumulation of value today and in what sense do all types of capital come together in Exchange Value?What does exploitation mean today? What is the main domain of exploitation \u2013 innovation, ideas, time, energy, attention devoted to various products?Innovation can be labour-saving, capital-saving, or neutral depending on its impact on the distribution of income between capital and labour. For Marx, innovation might create a febrile prosperity in short-run, but it would be at the expense of long-run degradation. Innovation and mechanisation depresses the average rate of profit; restoration of the rate of profit requires an increasingly large \u201creserve army of the unemployed\u201d (redundant population). Does this mean a need to rebel against innovation?If social and political criticism can no longer be a comfortable and safe occupation of a total point of view, what is critique at all? What is criticism in the field of immanence? Is it just an affirmation of an existing constellation or situation? Is the very imaging of life still capable of an act of resistance?\n\u00a0\nPresentations are expected to be between 20 and 30 minutes.\n\u00a0\nPlease send abstracts of max 300 words, attached in a word-document, with a short bio, to technologyandsocialization@gmail.com by 05 April 2020.\nShould you need any further information, do not hesitate to contact us at the same e-mail address.

The realms of creativity and technology are also subject to boundaries that limit the flow of knowledge and apply restrictions on the directions of design and artistic endeavour.\u00a0\u00a0\nTechnological advances and globalisation have caused the disruption of conventional means of communication and directly impacted the creative industries.\u00a0 The objective of this first issue of Kreativ is to explore the disruption of boundaries in various creative and technological contexts.\nTechnical boundaries are breached when a technology once used for personal communication alone becomes a conduit for mass media. The mobile phone has breached the boundaries of entertainment media, social debate and documentary, and has also encroached on the territory previously occupied by computers.\u00a0\nCultural boundaries are now breached with greater regularity and with a more permanent convergence of national identities, as the flow of people, ideas and traditions merge into a global multiplicity. The role of boundaries transforms as interactions across borders become opportunities for exploring the nature of blended cultures. This is in stark contrast to the often confrontational opposition of cultures in previous times.\u00a0\nIn this first issue we wish to consider the part that boundaries play in an altered world where territories are less defined and to evaluate the implications and outcomes of these disruptions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTopics to be included, but not limited to, are:\n\u00a0\nInternational collaborations in film and their cultural implicationsTechnologies of IoT and the virtual/real world interface3D animation, VFX\u00a0 and live-action film, the effects of VFX on cinemaGaming culture and its consequence in other media formsThe changing application of mobile applicationsWhen art and code collide in internet designSocial media and the convergence of media, reality and opinion\u00a0\nAbstract submission deadline\nThe deadline for abstract submissions is January 24, 2020.

The workshop is structured as a 3-day intensive retreat, which includes keynote speakers, roundtable sessions, and working Pods. This intimate program format of IRW promotes\u00a0 sustained community and conversation not often possible at conventional conferences.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe first organizing committee held its inaugural IRW in 2016 in Uppsala, Sweden.\u00a0 Motivated by the enormous success of the 2016 gathering, IRW organizers followed up in 2018 with a meeting in Ghent, Belgium.\u00a0 For 2020, we have conscientiously chosen to hold the 2020 workshop in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico at El Colegio de San Luis (also referred to as COLSAN), in order to gather academics, scholars, and activists who are thinking about language and communication as we stay critical of its limits and consequences. In alignment with this purpose, the working languages in 2020 will be English and Spanish with the aid of translation software and technology.\nProposals that broadly speak to the conference theme are encouraged but certainly not required. We encourage a wide range of topics and approaches, as we believe that this can and will enhance the discussion and workshop experience. In all, we invite you to participate in the 3rd IRW and look forward to reading the many exciting proposals that we hope this theme will inspire.\n\u00a0\nPage 1 of 2\n2020 Keynote Faculty and Faculty Mentors include:\nDr. Cristina D.

The time has come to take the humans involved in environmental issues as seriously as we have taken our fine-grained analyses of climate, ecosystems, hydrology, and all of the other facets of our \u201cnatural\u201d world. For several decades there have been efforts to better understand and intervene in the \u201chuman dimensions\u201d of environmental issues. Many of these efforts, however, have been guided by simple behaviourist or economic models of human thoughts and action, and dominated by quantitative approaches.\nIn contrast, the environmental humanities rest on a richer analysis of the underlying cultural frameworks that structure understanding of our environments. And so, taking the environment seriously has required humanities scholars to explore interdisciplinary approaches. While it is not yet clear what will happen under the umbrella of \u201cthe environmental humanities\u201d, one of the things that this label both allows and encourages is the broadening of conversations between humanities and social and natural science disciplines and beyond.\nWe invite you to join us from the 12th to 14th in Hawaii, USA to discuss in the fields of Education, Psychology and Social Sciences!\n\n http://www.apcesp.org\n\n\n apcesp@apcesp.org\n\n"}, {"title": "Feminism and Technology: A Depth Psychology Enquiry", "location": "Amnesty International, London ", "organization": "NA", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-06-25", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-31", "description": "Feminism and technology:\u00a0Embodied life for the female body is compromised by the ways and means of giving birth, raising children, displaying and living out identities, and gender.

What is translatable or not translatable through\u00a0the mediation of machines is a central question as we head into the era of neural translation and AI.\u00a0At the same time other questions emerge: are the existing models of collaborative translation,\u00a0crowdsourcing, machine translated corpora, and cloud-based CAT tools leading us towards a new\u00a0era of multi-modal plurality or to a fragmented dystopia where quality becomes a casualty?

During a two-day Face off in Lisbon participants will beable to confront their ideas about the subject, take part in intellectuallychallenging discussions and networking with new colleagues.\u00a0FACE is everywhere. It has travelled through a variety of cultural expressions,serving as an object of affection (e.g. photo albums, paintings), lending itself towardsobsession (e.g. Narcissus and Dorian Gray), serving as a metaphor (e.g. \u2018to loseone\u2019s face\u2019) or giving name to one of the most powerful enterprises in the world -Facebook. It has been a locus of fetishization and power, represented throughhistorical portraiture in sculpture, paintings and photography, from Greta Garbo\u2019sdivinity complexion in Queen Christina (Barthes 2007, 74) to the imperial portraits ofMajesties and Kings (Mirzoeff 2015). \u00a0It is also through the face that humans engage\nin recognition of both themselves as well as the other. The face operates as asensorial platform for communication and dialogue (L\u00e9vinas 1982) for verbal, non-verbal and sign languages.Faces may also be of a terrifying nature, dysmorphic traits serving as visage foralterity and difference, prompting to a state of conflict and uncertainty throughconfrontation, such as in the myth of Medusa or in Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. Wesee the face invading our everyday lives, constantly exhibited on social media, as ameans of communicating with others, as well as negotiating our own identity online.Digital technologies, in particular, have explored the face in a variety of contexts,promoting, for instance, photo filters and face-tuning apps, or developing facialrecognition systems and databases.FACE can also be understood from a perspective of absence or concealment,leading us towards the usage of digital avatars, masks and veils, many of which aresometimes paralleled with cultural and religious celebrations.We aim to discuss the different epistemologies created around the concept of \"face\",and bring together researchers from around the world for a face off on how face isexperienced and thought in their research areas. How does the face dictate how weperform, how all of our five senses are present in the face, how does the face frameone\u2019s individuality, one\u2019s identity traits or the way one thinks and makes meaning outof the world? How does one bestow meaning to the face? Likewise, can its absencebecome uncanny, and its invisibility connect to the unknown?We want to encourage discussing the face, in the encounter at the X GraduateConference in Culture Studies taking place on the 2nd and 3rd of April 2020 atUniversidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa in Lisbon.\u00a0\u00a0This Graduate Conference Face off is organized by three PhD students of the LisbonConsortium, the doctoral program in Culture Studies at the School of HumanSciences,Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa.

Unbounded\nPolitics of identity are central to language change. Here, linguistic boundaries rise and fall, motivating the ephemeral characteristics of language communities. The Mediterranean and European region is one replete with histories, with power struggles, uniquely demarcating nation, ethnicity, and community. For this, cultural and political identities, language ideologies, as well as the languages themselves, have sought boundedness, dynamics of which have indeed sought change over eons, through demographic movements, through geopolitics, through technological innovation. In a current era of technological advancement, transnational fluidity, intellectual power, capitalism, and new sexualities, then, we question, once again, the boundedness of language and identity, and ways in which to unbound languages and ideologies. More than before, we now increasingly pursue anthropological toil, so to innovate ways to locate these ideologies and their fluid boundaries, actively. We now need to increasingly unbind these languages, and their ideologies, so to arrive at progressive realizations, and to rectify, or at least see and move past, the segregations of old.\nThe COMELA 2020 theme, \u201cBounded languages\u2026 Unbounded\u201d, encapsulates the ongoing struggle throughout Mediterranean and European regions. As the continuous tension between demarcation, and the concurrent legitimization, of languages, language ideologies, and language identities, enters an era where new modes of interactivity require language communities to take on roles super-ordinate to the past, flexible citizenship now operates within, and not only across, language communities, to unbind languages, and to create new boundaries, unlike those ever seen throughout history.\nThe COMELA 2020 invites work which addresses the shifting boundedness of Language Communities of the Mediterranean and Europe. Papers and posters should acknowledge and describe processes of language shape, change, and ideology, pertinent to social, cultural, political histories, and futures of Mediterranean and European regions, and by those working in Mediterranean and European regions.\nPresentation lengths\u00a0 Colloquia \u2013 1.5 hours with 3-5 contributors (Parts A and B are possible, thus 6-10 contributors)\u00a0 General paper sessions \u2013 Approx. 20-25 minutes each, including 5 mins for questions/responses\u00a0 Posters \u2013 to be displayed at designated times throughout the COMELA 2020\nSubmission Guidelines (via the online submission website, or by email (see below))\nGeneral session papers- 18-word maximum title- 400-word maximum abstract, including references\nColloquia- Submission of only the main abstract for colloquium required- Abstract must contain the colloquium main description, and a summary of each individual paper within the colloquium\nEvaluation of proposals- All abstracts for general sessions will be double blind reviewed.- Main parent abstracts for colloquia will be double blind reviewed.

Nevertheless, it is a constant and growing threat: dispossession due to the climate crisis and environmental racism; the mass dispossession of bodies from their homelands due to civil unrest or state brutality; the consistent refusal of colonial nations to concede land to their original custodians; and neoliberal moves that render every cultural worker, artist and student economically precarious and bound to debt. These forms of dispossession are made profitable under disaster capitalism. Yet to speak of dispossession still foregrounds possession in an exchange system based on privatized ownership.\nNew systems of evaluation, new circulations of making, thinking, doing, and new modes of exchange are necessitated, in which dispossession might be a nucleus for positive, resistant, and insurrectionary models.

Commending this tendency, he wrote, \u201cIt seems that this fantastic dreamscape has completely vanished and that the real world re-emerges before our eyes, bathed in the clarity of a new day.\u201dYet even as this new realism seemed to return to mimetic functions remaindered by early twentieth century avant-gardes, it was by no means limited to the reproduction of surface appearances. Rather, the objects\u2014depicted with \u201cunemphatic\u201d clarity and verisimilitude\u2014seemed to radiate with uncanny vitality and power. \u201cWith the word \u2018magic\u2019\u2026\u201d Roh disclaimed, \u201cI wish to indicate that the mystery does not descend upon the represented world, but rather hides and palpates behind it.\u201d \u00a0A compound of two evidently adversarial terms, Magic Realism inhabits an apparent contradiction. This elastic term, still controversial, has been routinely applied to characterize representations of the real world in various media marked by strange or supernatural qualities that speak to psychological, social, and political alienation or to transcendental states. Artists from Felice Casorati to Georg Scholz, Paul Cadmus to Wifredo Lam, and at times even Edward Hopper to Frida Kahlo have been classified under this slippery label.\u00a0Stretched to new limits in the years following Roh\u2019s coinage, Magic Realism soon became characterized by its ease of dissemination and appropriation. In 1927, the term magico realismoappeared in Italian poet and playwright Massimo Bontempelli\u2019s journal 900, where it was first adopted as a literary style. The same year, Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset\u2019s Revista de Occidentepublished a Spanish translation of Roh\u2019s essay, which subsequently circulated throughout the Hispanic world. In 1949, Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier invented the term lo real maravilloso Americano to theorize what he perceived as an autochthonous Latin American form of Magic Realism unique to the region\u2019s culture, geography, and postcolonial situation.\u00a0 \u00a0Never a coherent style or aesthetic movement, Magic Realism has spanned the globe, extending from Europe to Asia, Latin America, and the United States, where, in 1943, the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s exhibition \u201cAmerican Realists and Magic Realists\u201d brought together more than forty historical and contemporary under its amorphous auspices. That the term has been adapted to so many geographical and cultural contexts has only enhanced the difficulty of ascribing it a concrete definition.\u00a0We welcome submissions on manifestations of Magic Realism from the interwar years and beyond, embracing all geographical contexts.Current graduate students, recent graduates, and emerging scholars from a variety of disciplines are invited to apply. We will consider papers on the visual arts, literature, poetry, dance, theater, and film, and especially welcome interdisciplinary and imaginative approaches to Magic Realist topics. We particularly encourage proposals that consider the indeterminacy of the category, and how it might relate to notions of identity and agency for the oppressed.\u00a0\u00a0Please submit abstracts of 150 to 300 words, accompanied by a c. v. and a brief bio (of 100 words) by January 24 to Stephanie Huber, Viviana Bucarelli, and Chloe Wyma at MagicRealismConference@gmail.com.\u00a0Topics and questions for discussion include but are not limited to:\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magic Realism \u201cafter\u201d modernism: questions of temporality, historicity, and anachronism ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magic Realism and the mediation of race, ethnicity, and class?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feminist interpretations of Magic Realism?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Queer readings of Magic Realism and gender?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Politicizations of Magic Realism on the left, right, and center ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transmedial narratives of Magic Realism ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical and theoretical debates on realism and reality ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical and theoretical debates on spirituality, and religion?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magic Realism and the state: questions of nationalism, war, and propaganda?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transnational histories of Magic Realism: questions of migration, translation, and displacement ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thingness, objecthood, and reification?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figuration, humanism, and embodiment ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Theatricality, performativity, and camp ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magic Realism and the machine: cyborgs, technology, prosthetics, and the posthuman ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relationships between Magic Realism and Social Realism, Surrealism, Neue Sachlichkeit, Precisionism, and other contemporaneous movements?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historiographies and reception histories of Magic Realism ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magic Realism and hierarchies of taste: relationships to elite and popular culture ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perceptions of modernity or post-modernity through a Magic Realist lens\u00a0\n\n MagicRealismConference@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "LCAFOOD 2020", "location": "Ellington Hotel: N\u00fcrnberger Str. 50-55, 10789 Berlin", "organization": "Organization: German Institute of Food Technologies ", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-10-13\r\n                        to 2020-10-16", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-19", "description": "The International Conference on Life Cycle Assessment of Food is the leading conference series on sustainability of food systems worldwide.

Thoughit is the only absolute in human lives, the limited knowledge that we have about this finality has always ensured a strange relationship between the life that we live before dying and the one (that we won\u2019t live) after the moment of our death. This strangeness is, primarily, a result of the clash between that which we definitively know against something that has always been unknown; where the promise of the moment of death does not necessitate a corresponding knowledge of either that moment or the ones after it. What remains, then, is just this strangeness as it gets entangled with our lived realities and disturbs the world that we live in. On the one hand we have the naturalness of our deaths, while on the other the speculation of everything after it.This speculation, in turn,desperately trying to make some sense of our absurd lives, begets a whole new world that is somehow both natural and outside it:the world of the supernatural and the occult, of ghosts and specters; of witchcraft and monsters; of vampires and werewolves; of Gods and Demons. This is a world that haunts our lives whether we are awake or asleep. This is a world that keeps on nagging at the corner of our minds, sometimes pulling us to the brink of madness. All humans, suffering from the essential strangeness, understand this pull that the supernatural have over them. It is, perhaps, because of this knowledge that eons ago our ape-like ancestors decide to appease these things that go bump in the night and worship them. This worshipping, however, is not a simple deification of the creatures of the night but an acceptance that nature is beyond the control of humans. However, this is a knowledge that seems to have waned in cultures that have subscribed to the idea of history as a march of mankind\u2019s progress. As organized religions developed in these cultures, thesecreatures of the night, once venerated,got recast as emblems of evil that needed to be exorcised.\nBeyond religion, and precisely at the time that religion\u2019s grip over public life began to recede and give way to a secular Reason, the twin emergence of European nation states and colonialism gave currency to a set of ideas that objectified the belief in the supernatural and dismissed it as superstitious or primitive. History, as can be seen in the case of \u201cdeveloped\u201d nations, ensures the privileging of empirical investigation, logic, and rationality to the lived,experiential, realities of its people.This is not to say that this world of ghosts and monsters simply gets discarded. They remain, in the dark recesses of collective memory, either as narrative metaphorsor pathological abstractions. Even so, while these \u201cdeveloped\u201dcultures have been inclined to define their natural reality through empirical rationality, the other \u201cdeveloping\u201d or \u201cunder-developed\u201d cultureshave followed a different path. Never really believing in (or, for that matter, having any reason to believe) the efficacy of empirical rationality, theyhave continued to actively retainan older order of existence \u2013 sometimes as a gesture of resistance to the homogenizing impulse of colonial modernity. In the continuity allowed to pagan and tribal affects within these postcolonial cultures, the supernatural is also accommodated within the natural order of experience. Instead of reducing the spectral or demonic incarnations of the world beyond death to a psychic symptomatology, the figures of horror are given a greater agency in the lives and fortunes of individuals and communities.\nWhat changes, then, is the experience that these cultures (and the individuals of these cultures) have of the supernatural. While the \u201cdeveloped\u201d civilizations strive to bind the monstrous within systems and institutions of human comprehension \u2013 either through the rationality of science or the metaphysics of organized religion \u2013 the other half of the world settles in for a more nuanced understanding,and subsequent acceptance,of the supernatural as it is. In other words, though the feeling and affectof horror that emanates from and because of the supernatural remains generally tied to the functions of fear, the nature of this horrorvaries in texture and impact. For the western world, for example, ghosts are either evil or epiphenomenal figments of imagination that need to be banished through psychiatry or exorcism. For other cultures, however, ghosts have a phenomenal presence of their own which cannot be wished, exorcised, or medicated away. In such a scheme of things, William Peter Blatty\u2019s novel The Exorcist exemplifies this western imagination of a haunting that, at all costs, needs to be amended. Marquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude, on the other hand, reveals a relationship between a ghost and a human that is more organic. The only way Jose Arcadio Buendia can find some relief from the horror set in because of Prudencio Aguilar\u2019s ghost is by accepting the latter in his spectral form. There is no getting rid of ghosts.\nGiven, therefore, that the experiences of horror are not just individual but also/simultaneously cultural, literary productions become rather potent sites for the relation of such experiences both on the individual and the cultural front. It\u2019s not coincidental, then, that either Blatty\u2019s or Marquez\u2019s novels become archetypes of the re-presentations of the way horror affects individuals placed inside different cultures. Such an affectation, though, is but a beginning of the ways in which the supernatural interacts with the human and gives rise to horror. Considering that almost all aspects of what we now designate as the Global North, and its concomitant, the Global South \u2013 political, historical, social, economic, cultural, and so on \u2013 function as different paradigms, the experiences of horror and their telling in stories become functionally different as well. Added to this are the variations that one nation or culture of the east has from another.\nThe present anthology of essays seeks to examine and demonstrate these cultural differences embedded in the impact that figures of horror and specters of the night have on the narrative imagination of storytellers from the Global South. If horror has an everyday presence in the phenomenal reality that Southern cultures subscribe to, it demands alternative phenomenology. The anthology allows scholars and connoisseurs of Horror to explore theoretical possibilities that may help address precisely such a need.\nThe book will be published by Bloomsbury India by the middle of 2020. Interested scholars are requested to send in an abstract of 300-500 words by the 23rd of December 2019 to horrorfictionanthology@gmail.com. Acceptances will be notified within a fortnight.

In fact, this multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary form that has persistently accompanied the different phases in the evolution of \u201cprint-capitalism\u201d has hardly been analysed from a theoretical perspective. This dismissal by the academic world is certainly peculiar, if not manifestly contradictory; however, it significantly testifies of the difficulty of investigating such a slippery object of study critically.The very \u2018physiognomy\u2019 of the book or film review, inherently wavering between the duty to inform and the needs of the market, influenced as it is by the definition of \u2018taste\u2019, makes this form difficult to tackle with a sound methodological approach. Since the beginning of the XVIII century, the book and film review has proved to be an essential interface between cultural supply and demand, and it has always been something more than a weapon to reach fame and recognition. Depending of the position gained in the literary or film fields, the review has often determined the success or failure of a creative enterprise, of a name or reputation. This particular device has been the yardstick of the most diverse sensibilities and tempers, from the learned expert to the passionate amateur. In this, its proliferation has foreshadowed the changes in the reception processes of works no longer provided with an \u2018aura\u2019 and therefore prone to the whims of a mass audience, whose judgments ultimately assessed their value.For these reasons, it is hard to trace the evolution of the \u2018review form\u2019 from a single point of view while focusing on the mechanisms that have triggered its fortune. As a crucial touchstone of intellectual production, the review still performs its essential normative function, contributing to outlining the ever-evolving \u201chorizon of expectations\u201d of its audiences, often identified with an ideal corpus which should epitomise a shared canon. On the other hand, as a social process, the review tends to keep track of the continuing dialectics between mainstream aesthetic values and their renegotiation in distinct contexts and/or communities of consumption.In the light of the rapidly-changing scenario of media and technologies, the conference \u201cBook Reviews and Beyond\u201d aims at exploring this compelling area of research in accordance with the interdisciplinary perspective of periodical studies, with particular focus on the period from the eighteenth century to the turn of the new millennium.\nThe topics that will be discussed include, but are by no means be limited to:\nScientific Committee:Paolo GiovannettiAndrea ChiuratoMara Logaldo\nOrganizing Committee:Dario BoemiaStefano LocatiLaura Sica\nDeadline for submissions:1 March, 2020\nPlease submit a 350-500 words abstract (with brief author bio and affiliation, 100 words) in English or Italian by 1 March 2020 to beyondbookreview2020@gmail.com .Panel submissions are welcome.

The rhetoric of the \u2018war on terror\u2019 and the \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 has promoted a geopolitical enemy. This has been accompanied by a shift towards a more \u2018muscular\u2019 liberalism. Secularization and cultural pluralism have dethroned the sacred. It has also destabilized the \u2018structure of power\u2019 with the concept that of the sacred was there to uphold a society rooted in a single source of religiously mandated authority. With the emergence of individualism with religion and culture, identity is now as much a matter of individual \u2018feeling\u2019 as it is about collective conceptions of the \u2018sacred\u2019, whether secularized or not.\nThe proposed edited book \"Religion in South Asian Fictions\" will trace the genealogy of South Asian Anglophone writing through blasphemy, the consequence of the complex forces and historical trajectories that go by the name of \u2018secularization\u2019. It will provide an account of the reception of South Asian Anglophone writing with the changing conceptions of racial Others and cultural difference, particularly with respect to minority writers.

Which approaches have historians taken to tackle this issue? In 1967, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie famously divided his colleagues into two categories: truffle hunters and parachutists. More than fifty years later this rigid distinction might seem like a tired clich\u00e9. All parachutists, after all, must safely land on the ground, while even the most talented truffle hunters need to take their eyes off the forest floor at some point.Nowadays, historians carefully choose and combine various scales, from the global to the local, in their research. The act of zooming in and out between them allows us to fundamentally change our notions of space. Whereas we used to look at spaces \u2013 in the widest sense of the word \u2013 as fixed areas, delimited by a number of easily identifiable fence-posts, they increasingly appear to us as a set of blurred boundaries, constantly eluding our attempts to pin them down. Adjusting our focus to such ambivalent and contradictory spaces allows us to discern trajectories inside and across them which would have otherwise remained hidden from view. Following these trajectories can lead us to reveal networks which operate in hitherto invisible spaces, giving us a different perspective on supposedly fixed categories. By changing the scale, movement may emerge where before only stasis was visible, and fluidities may appear where previously only certainty was found.\nWhat kind of questions arise for historians as a result of adjusting the scale? How do these questions influence the way we engage with spaces and trajectories? The 14th Annual Graduate Conference in European History invites participants to discuss these and other related questions. We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to:\n\u2013 Defining scales in historical research: Micro, Meso, Macro\u2013 The Global in Microhistory, the Micro in Global history\u2013 Following personal trajectories to decentre master narratives\u2013 Transcending spatial and social boundaries\u2013 People, ideas and objects in motion\u2013 Networks of power, information, and technology\u2013 Transcultural and/or transnational spaces\u2013 Fluidity across historical categories: Gender, Race, Class\u2013 Reconceptualizing the relationship between public and private spheres\u2013 The Spatial turn and its influence on historical method and theory\u2003\nSubmission Details:\nPaper abstracts of up to 300 words and a brief biography of up to 100 words should be submitted through our online abstract submission platform by the end of 31 December 2019:https://cfp.tempopedia.org/graceh2020/cfpIf their proposal is accepted, participants will receive a notification of acceptance no later than 31 January 2020.\nFinal papers of up to 2,000 words should be submitted by 15 March 2020, so they can be pre-circulated to commentators in a timely fashion.

Mobile communication technologies are expected to progress far beyond anything seen so far in wireless-enabled applications, making everyday lives smoother and safer and dramatically improving the efficiency of businesses. As fifth generation (5G) research is maturing towards a global standard, we in the research community must focus on the development of beyond-5G solutions and the 2030 era, that is, 6G, and beyond. It is not clear yet what 6G will entail. It will undoubtedly include relevant technologies considered too immature for 5G or which are outside the defined scope of 5G. More specifically, the way in which data is collected, processed, transmitted and consumed within the wireless network will be a key driver for 6G. Enabling this vision requires addressing a myriad of theoretical and practical challenges. These next-generation wireless networks must support ultra-reliable, low-latency communication and intelligently manage a massive number of Internet of Things, or even Internet of Everything and Future internet of Everything devices in real-time, within a highly dynamic environment. At the same time, the generation and consumption of wireless data are becoming increasingly distributed with an ongoing paradigm shift from people-centric to machine-oriented communications, making the operation of future wireless networks even more complex. This need for stringent communication quality-of-service requirements as well as mobile edge and core intelligence can only be realized by integrating fundamental notions of artificial intelligence and deep learning across the wireless infrastructure and end-user devices, where systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. Enabling the vision requires addressing a myriad of theoretical and practical challenges.\nObjective5G mobile communication is still in a nascent stage and on account of carriers proceeding cautiously with this technology, its potential has not yet been fully realized. We are yet to see just how 5G itself can provide lightning-fast connectivity, affording a world of close to zero-lag that would permit surgeons to perform surgery with the aid of robotics from across the world, and live sports events projected in holograms, untethered virtual reality streaming, which are just three examples of the possibilities among a raft of next-generation use cases. But that is not stopping futurist researchers already identifying limitations and exploring what the next iterative phase will hold. Logic suggests that 6G will offer further extreme reductions in latency and ever-faster downloads speeds - potentially reaching 1 terabit/second, an outstanding jump from the 20 gigabits that 5G offers to date. We will thus be calling for highly innovative, state-of-the-art contributions in the form of original papers in all areas related to 6G research where authors would investigate artificial intelligence-enabled sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Scholars will be expected to discuss the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, terahertz communications, optical wireless technology, free space optic network, blockchain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communications, unmanned aerial vehicle, cell-free communications, integration of wireless information and energy transfer, integration of sensing and communication, integration of access-backhaul networks, dynamic network slicing, holographic beamforming, and big data analytics that can assist the 6G architecture development in guaranteeing the quality of service. The potential applications should be associated with the requirements and the possible technologies for 6G communication, which would include the possible challenges and research directions to reach this goal.\nTarget AudienceThe potential of artificial intelligence and wireless networks is impacting all sectors, from healthcare to energy and transport, from finance and insurance to retail. It has assumed a pervasive ubiquitous macrocosm, and its positive transformational potential has already been acknowledged in multitudinous key sectors. It has as objective to amalgamate data owners, data analysts, skilled data professionals, cloud service providers, companies from industry, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, research institutions and universities and will be useful to participants from both the industry and academia working in all the domains of big data, artificial intelligence, robotics and engineering, but all other target audience includes: * Researchers, * Scientists, * City planners, * Future Policy Makers, * Professionals in the finance sector, * Smart Innovators, * Space Science Engineers, * Mechanical Engineers, * Electrical Engineers, * Computer Science Engineers, * Information Technology Experts, * Robotic Technologist, * Design Engineers, * Law Professionals, * Gaming professionals, * Automation Industry Leaders, * Health Care Service Providers, * Defense Research Professionals, * Automation Industry Leaders, * Managers and Business Intelligence Experts, * Advertising and Promotion Agency Executives, * Professionals in media sector, * Academics, * Students, * R and D leaders, * Entrepreneurs, * Innovation peers.\nSubmission ProcedureResearchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before January 22, 2020, a chapter proposal of 1,000 to 2,000 words clearly explaining the mission and concerns of their proposed chapter.

Literature has been frequently said to \u201cdepict\u201d or \u201cimitate\u201d reality, theater has been described as an imago mundi, and political writing for the instruction of rulers in Medieval and Renaissance literature was known as specula principum (mirrors of princes), where readers were encouraged to examine their own virtues and qualities, as one does in front of a mirror. We talk about \u201canamorphosis\u201d and \u201cekphrasis\u201d in literature. Fiction rests on imagination, or the cognitive capacity of creating images without any immediate input from the senses. At the end of 19th century, Louis and Auguste Lumi\u00e8re invented the cin\u00e9matographe, making images even more accessible to an avid public eager to consume them. Moreover, the cinema industry has recently introduced us to 3D, holograms, and graphic effects that further blur the tenuous distinction between appearance and reality. As the old adage asserts, \u201can image is worth a thousand words.\u201d However, how much can we actually trust what we see? What is the relationship between images constructed in literature/painting/cinema and reality? How can images be deceitful? Are images dangerous? In his dystopian vision of image-based reality, the so-called father of postmodernism Jean Baudrillard posits that \u201cseductive\u201d simulacra transmitted through a plethora of digital screens are on the verge of eclipsing the real entirely. Recent political controversies revolving around the incessant dissemination of \u201calternative facts\u201d for immediate mass consumption have led some theorists to speculate that we have entered into a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era in which all semblance of meaning has been effaced by the ubiquity of contrived images linked to a hyperreal spectacle that has lost all connection to reality. In the words of the Baudrillard scholar Douglas Kellner, this phenomenon is the \u201ccarnival of mirrors\u201d to which the maverick philosopher refers in his radical reworking of symbolic exchange.\nA few possible subtopics for this theme include: ekphrasis in literature, anamorphosis in literature and painting, perspective, film studies, visions and apparitions in literature, scientific observation, imagination and fiction, mirrors in literature / painting / film, literature / painting / film as mirror of reality, appearance and deception, blurring of the limits between image and reality, simulacrum, spectacle, the advent of hyperreality, the inception of the post-truth era, the evolution of pedagogical techniques in the ubiquitous realm of simulation.\n\n https://www.cmll.msstate.edu/symposium/call-for-papers/\n\n\n kam131@msstate.edu\n\n"}, {"title": "PATCH UP!

In this sonic-technological culture, unconventional attitudes towards musical creation and performance have interfaced with the principles of electricity to reveal not only evolving modes of thinking with technology, but also distinct communities that emerge alongside them\u2014as well as the social, political, and aesthetic conditions from which all of these arise. Inspired by the conceptual and practical dimensions of modular synthesis, Patch Up! is a workshop that aims to explicitly enact modular philosophies of connectivity with a scholarly sensibility, but in a way that is explicitly unbounded by academic formats. We thus invite musicians, users, module designers, as well as scholars to together explore the capacity of the act of \u201cpatching\u201d for re-orienting our selves to science, technology, society, and the senses in the post-digital age.\u00a0\nParticipants are encouraged to reflect on the plurality of connections fostered through modular synthesis in any variety of format. Proposals may be for written papers, musical compositions, DIY activities, demonstrations, sonic happenings, etc. provided that the idea aspires to collaboration and accounts for the diversity of interests, orientations, and identities of all workshop participants. The workshop is to be organized around interactive and mutual engagement as opposed to the convention of reading or otherwise delivering content to a passive audience. Participants will integrate with each others\u2019 work over a two-day period at York University, Toronto, Canada.\nPotential topics include:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Historical and philosophical investigations into modular synthesis that emphasize the roles of ideology, power, race, and gender\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ethnographic/ethnomusicological studies of modular synth users and communities\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Circuit designs and patching techniques as non-linear paradigms of creativity and technology use\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research/practice-based explorations in-between post-digital living and modular synthesis\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The modular synth as a counterpart to multi-use, screen-based digital media and its implications for creativity, innovation, and development\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modular synthesis and its relationship to identity, self-expression, and obsession\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical explorations and presentations of programming, product development, new module ideas, prototypes etc.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performative, musical and/or artistic expressions of modular synthesis as a technology to think with and through\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modular synthesis as material culture, including questions of consumerism and collection\nPlease send proposals of 200-300 words to patchupatyork@gmail.com\u00a0 by January 8, 2020.\nIndividuals of any background are welcome to apply.\n\n kitzmann@yorku.ca\n\n"}, {"title": "(RE)THINKING EARTH: FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF NATURE TO CLIMATE CHANGE FICTIONINTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM", "location": "Portugal (Lisbon)", "organization": "Organization: CETAPS and Portuguese National Library", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-04-22\r\n                        to 2020-04-23", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-03-15", "description": "(RE)THINKING EARTH: FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF NATURE TO CLIMATE CHANGE FICTIONINTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM\n22-23 April,\nNational Library of Portugal, Lisbon\nCETAPS/Nova University of Lisbon\nCALL FOR PAPERS\nEarth Dayfirst celebrated in the United States on April 22, 1970 by millions of people and now mobilizing citizens and communitiesworldwide, represented the first massive expression of public concern with the ecological sustainability of our planet, launching the modern global environmentalist movement.

The editorial committee is constituted bymembers of UNESCO-MOST, the International Council of Philosophy and Human Sciencesand M\u00e9moire de l\u2019Avenir.The theme of the first issue is Big Data & Singularities: Creativity as a Basis for Re-thinkingthe Human Condition. We aim to investigate this topic from a multi- and cross-disciplinaryperspective\u2014including but not limited to philosophy, history, anthropology, archaeology,literature, sociology, economics, political science, linguistics, archaeology, aesthetics andethics.The understanding of the need to foster a close collaboration between the Humanitiesand the Arts led to the establishment of the Arts and Society project by The InternationalCouncil for Philosophy and Human Sciences (CIPSH) in partnership with UNESCO-MOSTand M\u00e9moire de l\u2019Avenir, first presented at the World Humanities Conference and nowexperiencing a consolidation and expansion, also in partnership with the Global ChineseArts and Culture Society (GCACS).\nHASThe Magazine of Humanities, Arts and Society\nREQUIREMENTSApplicants can send articles in French or English, in one of the following formats:News \u2013 up to 1500 words and 1 imageShort notes \u2013 up to 3000 words and 1-2 imagesArticles \u2013 up to 5000 words and 3-8 imagesPhotos and illustrations should be minimum 300dpiIt is the author\u2019s responsibility to collect all the relevant permissions for the submittedmaterial.Submissions accompanied by a CV or biography (100 words) and abstract (100 words),should be sent to hasmagazine@arts-and-society.orgFor questions and more information, contact contact@arts-and-society.orgThe deadline for submissions is January 31, 2020 at midnight, Central European Time\nMORE INFORMATION ON THE TOPICBig Data & Singularities:Creativity as a Basis for Re-thinking the Human Condition\nbig da\u00b7tanoun / COMPUTINGExtremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends,and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactionsBig Data offers tools and opportunities to improve actions and decision-making, servingall fields of development, including government, healthcare, education, employment,economic productivity, communication, crime prevention, security, ecology, environment,and natural disasters. Big Data provides possibilities for giving consideration to the\u201coverlooked or unremarked\u201d in populations or regions that have inadequate technology,economic resources, or human resources.Yet Big Data poses privacy concerns, as it accumulates daily information from everywhere\u2014from the personal messages we send to each other, from images we publish, from onlineresearch, and from transactional records of purchases\u2014all of which becomes globalinformation accessible to big-data facilities.Big Data brings benefits, but can also create difficulties in maintaining personal independenceand the freedom of identities\u2014when, for instance, it is used by speculators in the financialmarkets or by insurance companies. Used across domains and disciplines, they influence ourfreedom of choice and action. Each and every one of us is affected by it, individually andcollectively.On the other hand, each of the world\u2019s elements is unique, and these singularities reflectdistinct personal perceptions while attributing wisdom and understanding to our facultiesand our senses. Singularities produce hypotheses, sciences, cultures, and arts.This is exactly how major technological advances emerge, launched from processes ofcreativity and insight, leading to new inventions and producing global media tools thatcreate endless figures, notes, and elements that make up big data.Arts and cultures mirror the journey of humanity and the entirety of its creation\u2014a reflectionof ongoing research into the world\u2019s wonders and of human nature, inventing languages tocreate and transmit culture. The arts are conduits to inquiry and discovery, a search for newways to express, resist, act, and do. Culture is inseparable from development; it reflectsthe living memories and productions of humanity, and gives importance to differences,pluralism, as well as the common and universal virtues of people.The first issue of HAS magazine aims to represent scientific reflections and theoreticalconcerns as well as analyses and reviews of artworks and creative practices investigatingthe above ideas.Contributions may include\u2014but are not limited to\u2014investigations of the followingquestions:How should we consider \u201cBig Data\u201d? How can we find a balanced and objective survey ofthis phenomenon? What are the advantages that it brings to everyday life? Who can takeadvantage of it, and how? What are the implicit dangers connected to its wide application?What can artists and intellectuals do to disseminate further knowledge on the importanceof its proper, ethical use?How are singularities and serendipity connected to Big Data? What is the importance ofsingularities in today\u2019s world, where one of the most dangerous challenges seems to bethe homogenisation of individuals, where personality diminishes and becomes only analgorithmic data element? How can we maintain and promote creative individuality?On the other hand, is Big Data necessarily in opposition to singularity? Can the two findareas of positive and mutual benefit? How can the information gained from the analyses ofBig Data contribute to the unfolding of creative singularity?The arts do not replace science and are not reducible to the concerns of thesciences, but they participate in the process of developing the creativity, theimagination of new futures, of diversity and of critical thinking.Luiz Oosterbeek \u2013 Director of HAS Magazine\nEDITORIAL TEAMDIRECTOR Luiz OosterbeekDIRECTOR Margalit BerrietHONORARY DIRECTOR GCACS - Professor Xiang Xiong LinEDITOR Zoltan SomhegyiCO-EDITOR Aurore NerrinckCREATIVE DIRECTOR - PROJECT MANAGER Marie-C\u00e9cile BerdaguerART DIRECTOR Axelle AlbetENGLISH EDITING Dan MeinwaldPUBLIC RELATIONS Florence ValabregueADMINISTRATION-PRODUCTION Victor Gr\u00e9sardCOORDINATOR Katarina JansdottirWEBMASTER Labib Abderemane, Georges ChmargounofGENERAL MANAGER, OPERATIONS M\u00e9moire de l\u2019AvenirINSTITUTIONAL ADVISORY Arts and Society - UNESCO-MOST - The International Councilfor Philosophy and Human Sciences(CIPSH)- Memoire de l\u2019Avenir (MDA)\nHAS: The Magazine for Humanities, Arts and Society was born from the original idea ofProfessor Xiang Xiong Lin.\u00a9 Arts and Society, ParisEditorial information hasmagazine@arts-and-society.orgAll rights reserved.

The volume is focused on the intervention of foreign powers, especially the United States, in Latin America, the region\u2019s international relationships and the reconfiguration of the power and status of the different Latin American states in the face of these foreign presences. The growing importance of international mechanisms in enabling the success of certain Latin American regimes is also highlighted, in particular the influence of regional diffusion through international organizations or other networks 2) Problems and Alternatives in the Modern Americas This volume begins by exploring the situation in some Latin American countries including Argentina, Mexico and Brazil and analyses the relations between Latin American countries such as Uruguay and Cuba, and Mexico and Paraguay, from a historical-political point of view this volume also highlights the new challenges faced by the region as a result of changes in politics and party systems such as the diversity of presidential democracy in Latin America and increased political pluralism 3) Setbacks and Advances in the Modern Latin American Economy This volume provides an overview of the Latin American economy. It studies the economy of Latin America in a comparative manner, analyzing the experience of crisis and recovery of different countries in the region, and presents an economic history up to the present day which demonstrates how the cycles of economic and macroeconomic instability are framed by periods of dictatorship and democratic fragility. 4) Social, Political, and Religious Movements in the Modern Americas The volume explores transformations that have occurred in Latin America. For example, although the frequency of economic crises has lowered, the number of migrants continues to increase. Additionally, although the region is currently home to the largest number of democratic governments in its history since the 1960s this has not led to a lower level of social conflict but has coincided with an increase in the severity of social strife. The volume studies the dominant social conflicts of the region, such as migration, and evaluate their consequences related to the profound \"crisis of values\" and the question of the importance and influence of the Catholic Church and other religious denominations in Latin America arecollected. In the midst of various political and economic crisis, the Catholic Church has sought to accentuate the value of work, rejecting the absolute empire of the market The date for submission of the final article will be the first week of April 2020 Due to the number of proposals the articles will not exceed 10,000 words, in English, Chicago citation.

Coming down from the pages of American comics, they have made their way into the most diverse areas of modern culture: cinema, computer games, anime, cosplay, etc. They are no longer heroes only for young people, becoming a kind of cultural core around which a whole universe of images, ideas, meanings, concepts, etc. is built.\nThe emergence of the superhero phenomenon is connected with the neo-mythological paradigm of American Mass Culture as an integral feature of the early 20th century Modernist cultural model. The superhero appears in a period of depressive moods in society. Their emergence is close to the collective dream of common Americans seeking support and encouragement in somebody during the economic and social crises, united by the common name of the Great Depression. The new hero shows such traits as willingness to come to the rescue of an ordinary human, to risk his own life, and the quintessence of heroism itself - death for the interests of others.\nIt is certain that a superhero is a kind of litmus test that indicates the directions of modern society development. But it is also a testing ground, where certain ideas are tested, because society votes with its attitude to each new image of a superhero, approaching it quite critically, accepting or rejecting it. Therefore, we can say that a superhero is a dynamic figure, developing and well indicating the state of public moods, aspirations and expectations.\nActualization of the superhero character in the 21st century is a marker of complex global problems that humankind has faced.

That oligopoly was (temporarily?) broken by the introduction of social media with its revolutionary promise to democratize civil discourse and civil society. It has offered diverse groups the opportunity to connect to one another and form communities of practice that ultimately can serve to strengthen their voice. However, in recent years, we have also discovered that connecting the world via social media leads to new challenges. When so many diverse voices are brought together on a massive scale, conflict is common. Interpretation of this conflict is itself diverse: do we see a rise of incivility or freedom from moral policing? Extremism or idealism? Distrust or critique? The very same digital tools that amplify voices of the marginalized can also be used to silence diverse voices online through online harassment, doxing, trolling, and other measures.\u00a0\nIn this context, the\u00a0International Conference on Social Media & Society\u00a0invites scholarly and original submissions that explore key questions and central issues related (but not limited) to the 2020 theme of \u201cDiverse Voices: Promises and Perils of Social Media For Diversity.\u201d We welcome research from a wide range of methodological perspectives employing established quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods as well as innovative approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries and expand our understanding of the current and future trends in social media research, especially research that seeks to explore questions such as:\n\n https://socialmediaandsociety.org\n\n\n ask@socialmediaandsociety.org\n\n"}, {"title": "Clio: A Journal of Literature, History, and the Philosophy of History: Call for Submissions", "location": "N/A", "organization": "NA", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-11-26", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-11-26", "description": "Clio: A Journal of Literature, History, and the Philosophy of History,\u00a0a double-blind peer-reviewed international interdisciplinary journal, publishes scholarly essays that explore the connections between history, literature, and the arts.

Although the terms \u201canti-intellectual\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d were coined relatively recently, such terms connote trends which often reappear in different guises. The consequences of these trends translate into a growing and widespread distrust of authority. The prevalence of this phenomenon necessitates a discussion of subjectivism, rejection of scientific innovation, propaganda, political climates, societal conflict, and other concepts related to subjective and objective notions of reality. In any period of such upheaval, we must ask: How have waves of anti-intellectualism and subjective truths ebbed and flowed in different periods? What can it mean to be \u201cbeyond reality\u201d? Perhaps the credo, \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d is better expressed as \u201cI think, therefore I am right\u201d (as illustrated by meme artist Shovel). We are looking for papers discussing truth, post-truth, and illusion in society and cultural representations.\n\u00a0\nWe pose these questions specifically to fields pertaining to literature, anthropology, cultural studies, classical studies, digital humanities, philosophy, art history, history, and sociology, but gladly welcome submissions from all fields pertaining to the topic of the conference.\n\u00a0\nPossible session topics include but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Language, identity, and truth\n\u2022 Scientific denialism, construction of scientific fact, and scientism\n\u2022 Post-truth and post-intellectualism in culture\n\u2022 Truth and post-truth in genre media (mystery, fantasy, science fiction, horror, etc.)\u2022 Unreliable narration, ambiguity, and uncertainty\n\u2022 Art as truth or illusion\n\u2022 Disdain for authority\n\u2022 Unworlding and truth\n\u2022 Epistemology, truth regimes, and cultural hegemony\u00a0\nConference Structure: This conference/workshop will be comprised of the keynote address and panels on Friday, followed by additional panels on Saturday.

This year\u2019s conference will interrogate frames of justice, criminality, deviancy, and resistance.\nJacques Derrida states that justice \u201cis that which must not wait.\u201d At the same time, he acknowledges the paradox that justice has yet to arrive: \u201cjustice remains, is yet, to come,\u00a0venir.\u201d In Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail,\u201d King describes the \u201cmyth of time\u201d that society propagates to maintain social, class, and racial hierarchies. The government, media, and public caution marginalized peoples to \u201cbe patient\u201d and \u201cwait\u201d\u2014they say that justice will come in time. Through this spiritual bypassing, society can falsely, but effectively, accuse those fighting for justice as \u201cagitators\u201d and \u201cincendiaries.\u201d The fight for justice thus becomes framed as criminal and deviant behavior. MLK resists this framing in his letter when he urges us to see that \u201c\u2018justice too long delayed is justice denied.\u2019\u201d This tension between justice yet to come and justice that cannot be delayed demonstrates the complicated, variant, and urgent purviews of justice.\nCCC 2020 seeks submissions that explore the broad concepts of \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ccriminality,\u201d or \u201cdeviancy.\u201d Whether it is the media and government\u2019s targeting of civil rights activists in the 1960s, the policing of black, indigenous, poor, and migrant folks, or in the criminalization of LGTBTQ+ identities, \u201cdeviance\u201d is punished by society. Thus, \u201cjustice framed\u201d can mean anything from social justice activism to the ways in which \u201cjustice\u201d is used to advance oppression.\u00a0While the theme asks that we think about the many ways that justice is \u201cframed\u201d (e.g. how it is formulated, how it is repudiated, and how it is abstracted), it also asks that we radically and consciously reimagine what justice could be.

How does cultural production reach across this ontological chasm with surprising, and sometimes even shocking, results? In this impasse, words function as overdetermined phantasms of a culture that orient how we articulate and recognise our aspirations, affections, ambivalence, and antipathy. In this social matrix, words\u2014and by implication, language\u2014are imagined as cultural specters: as ahistorical poltergeistic entities that reinforce a predictable present.\u00a0\nGrappling with the implications of these cultural complexities, the biennial graduate student conference at the Rutgers University Program in Comparative Literature invites responses that meditate on the instability of language and how it acts as a phantasm that shifts our collective culture, in ways both generative and deleterious. In this conference, we want to explore language\u2019s vitality to our understanding of the porous divide between the public and the private/personal, between human and non-human. How does language figure in facilitating the discursive, political and lived landscape(s) we are subject to? What are the limits and possibilities of language, the duplicities of language and the permissibilities of classification, taxonomy, and the nomenclatures that enable or disrupt experiences of cultural, material, physical, and social displacement? How does the transience of language function across time, space, and borders\u2014including those borders it helps to create\u2014and what is the role of literary and/or interdisciplinary studies in probing these functions?\u00a0\nWe invite Graduate students who are interested in presenting at the conference, either through research papers, creative nonfiction essays, fiction/short stories, poetry, or performance, to submit an abstract of 300 words that address these questions.\nPossible paper topics include, but are not limited to:\nTranslation and communication across bordersMultilingualism and/or translingualism\u00a0Identity, memory, trauma, and mourningNonce words and shifting meanings/definitionsSilences in cultural production\u00a0\u00a0Spectral pasts and/or speculative futures\u00a0Anti-colonial/decolonial tongues; linguistic and geopolitical borders\u00a0Artificial intelligence and posthumanismThe environmental imagination and the language of climate change\u00a0\u00a0Gender and sexuality discourses\u00a0Hauntology, ghosts, and genre discourses\u00a0\nThe deadline for paper proposals is 11:59 PM on January 15th, 2020.

Who is involved in these processes? How does history remember these events? What helps migrants and societies to adapt? The significance of these and related questions have made their way into our daily lives, from the refugee crisis to policy decisions, individual psychotherapy to (re)building identities, communities, and memories. \u00a0\nDuring the conference, we are going to turn our attention to processes that are integral to human experience: migration, adaptation, and memory. We are interested in all aspects of migration and adaptation, in their individual and collective dimensions, in the past and in the present-day world. We would like to examine the role of memory, the processes of migrating and adapting to various dynamic life circumstances, across time, space, culture, language, and discipline.\u00a0\nTherefore, we strive to represent and discuss the crossroads of migration, adaptation, and memory in their multiple representations: psychological, social, historical, cultural, philosophical, religious, neurological, organizational, methodological, economic, political, and many others. We will also devote considerable attention to how these phenomena appear and transform in artistic practices: literature, film, theatre, and visual arts. This is why we invite researchers representing various academic disciplines: anthropology, history, psychiatry, psychology, psychoanalysis, sociology, politics, philosophy, economics, law, literary studies, theatre studies, film studies, design, project management, memory studies, migration studies, consciousness studies, dream studies, gender studies, postcolonial studies, medical sciences, cognitive sciences, and urban studies, to name a few.\u00a0\nDifferent forms of presentations are encouraged, including case studies, theoretical inquiries, personal reflections, problem-oriented arguments, comparative analyses, and creative expressions.\u00a0\nWe will be happy to hear from experienced scholars and young academics, doctoral and graduate students, as well as professionals from various disciplines. We also invite all persons interested in participating in the conference as listeners, without giving a presentation.\u00a0\nOur repertoire of suggested topics includes but\u00a0is not limited\u00a0to:\u00a0\nI.

Monstrous\u00a0bodies, sexual and erotic\u00a0bodies,\u00a0bodies\u00a0at war, modified\u00a0bodies,\u00a0bodies\u00a0coming of age and ageing,\u00a0bodies\u00a0being tested by nature,\u00a0bodies\u00a0enhanced by (bio)technology, politicised\u00a0bodies\u00a0and more, all are core to respective story genres.\n\u00a0\nTelling stories about the\u00a0body\u00a0is therefore loaded with ideological, political, sociological, theological, ontological and aesthetic implications. At a time when the world\u2019s socio-political landscape is dominated by the construction of barriers between people based on race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation and class, it is more important than ever to consider how stories about\u00a0bodies, and the perception of\u00a0bodies\u00a0shaped by stories, not only foster division and difference but also inspire cohesion and belonging. And while stories can create both tangible and intangible barriers between human beings, they can also foster awareness and compassion for our common humanity.\n\u00a0\nVarious disciplines, practices and professions have inscribed stories and\u00a0bodies\u00a0with particular meanings that, when viewed in isolation, can be skewed and limiting. Accordingly, our project aims to emphasise inclusivity, dialogue and collegiality. Building on our first two exceedingly successful, inclusive interdisciplinary events,\u00a0Storytelling\u00a0and the\u00a0Body\u00a0seeks to explore the complex, multi-faceted dynamics of this symbiotic relationship between\u00a0storytelling\u00a0and the\u00a0body.\n\u00a0\nWe offer opportunities for artists, photographers, practitioners, theorists, independent scholars, academics, performers, writers, and others to intermingle, providing platforms for interdisciplinary interactions that are fruitful and conducive to broadening horizons and sparking future projects, collaborations, and connections.\u00a0Storytelling\u00a0and the\u00a0Body\u00a0works with a view to generating and supporting dialogue, and creating a publication to engender further collaboration and discussion.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nOur second global inclusive interdisciplinary conference welcomes proposals for presentations, displays, exhibits, round tables, panels, interactive workshops and other activities to stimulate engagement and discussion on any aspect of the interplay between stories and\u00a0bodies. Subject to the presentations and discussions which take place at the meeting, there is a possibility for a selective publication to emerge with the aim of engendering further interdisciplinary collaboration and discussion.\n\u00a0\nKey topics, themes and issues for discussion may include, but are definitely not limited to:\n\u00a0\nNon-human\u00a0bodies\u00a0 |\u00a0 AI / robotic\u00a0bodies\u00a0 |\u00a0 Post-human\u00a0bodies\u00a0 |\u00a0 Monstrous\u00a0bodies\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Bodies\u00a0and donation of parts\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Body\u00a0art: implants, painting, piercings, tattoos, scarification, sculpting, shaping\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Body\u00a0modifications/mutilations\u00a0 |\u00a0 Trafficked\u00a0bodies\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Body\u00a0taboos\n\u00a0\nBodies\u00a0and -\nPlease also feel free to suggest your own topic where\u00a0bodies\u00a0and stories intersect.

Please feel free to put forward proposals that you think will get the message across, in whatever form.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the conference we will be exploring ways in which we can develop the discussions and dialogues in new and sustainable inclusive interdisciplinary directions, including research, workshops, publications, public interest days, associations, developing courses etc which will help us make sense of the topics discussed during the meeting. There is an intention, subject to the discussions which emerge during the course of the meeting, to form a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration.\n\u00a0\n300 word proposals, presentations, abstracts and other forms of contribution and participation should be submitted by Friday 10th January 2020.

Often focused on differences between generations and triggered by specific events and objects, there is an overpowering sense that things are not what they used to be. This can be a positive experience, for example, being impressed at technological progress, or conversely confusingly negative, for example, the sense of frustration with the same technology and a hankering for times when things were perceived to be much simpler and easier.\n\u00a0\nNostalgia\u00a0is an extremely powerful feeling; it can in equal measure lift us up, make us feel safe, create fond memories and/or it can bring us down, make us feel intensely isolated, lonely, left behind and depressed. There is\u00a0nostalgia\u00a0for things that are no longer with us and people who are no longer with us (individually and collectively). There is the sense that things that are out of place \u2013 and not only out of place but also out of time. It can be both missing things and the missing of things. Yet it can also be a real and quite intense force which forms the present and informs the future.\n\u00a0\nThe 2nd meeting of this biennial global inclusive interdisciplinary project will continue to map the boundaries of\u00a0nostalgia, explore the parameters within which it takes place and tentatively assess the consequences for ways of thinking, living and feeling in the 21st century.\u00a0Nostalgia\u00a0is being approached as a multi-layered phenomenon which consequently requires multiple insights and perspectives from academic disciplines, professional practice, ngo and voluntary activities, artists, song writers, performers and anyone who engages with forms and varieties of\u00a0nostalgia.\n\u00a0\nFrom the conversations and dialogues which take place, our intention is to form a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nWe welcome proposals from a wide range of perspectives and voices, on topics including but not limited to:\n\u00a0\nWhat To Send\nThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

Back on his feet and back in Paris, Mauss noticed the same gait among Parisian women: \u201cIn fact, American walking fashions had begun to arrive [in France], thanks to the movies.\u201d However problematically gendered it now appears, Mauss\u2019s observation, which he made in connection with his study Techniques of the Body (1934), alerts us to an important mode of knowledge circulation that we define as \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d: implicit, informal, and uncodified knowledge acquired in, with, and through filmand cinema that informs cultural and social practice outside the cinematic dispositif. Drawing on Michael Polanyi\u2019s concept of \u201ctacit knowledge,\u201d the notion of \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d allows us to theorize how tacit epistemic templates that use cinematic forms and techniques configure and enable daily activities, social interactions, warfare, education, and working procedures.\nThe theorization of \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d also has a historical dimension. Cinematic techniques have been common in many fields of cultural practice since the development of moving image technologies, and configurations of film have continuously appeared in unexpected locations and unsuspected forms, formats, usages, and temporalities beyond the cinema. In the late 1930s, Eisenstein described architecture in terms of a \u201cmontage sequence ... subtly composed, shot by shot\u201d by his legs as he walked among the buildings of the Acropolis. In the early 1940s, war reporter and novelist Vasily Grossman wrote about the experience of battle, stating that he was \u201cforever feeling as if I am on the cinema screen, not just watching it.\u201d Today, airports, data centers, weather stations, laboratories of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics, corporations, military bases, schools are just a few examples of sites where cinematic knowledge routinely supports and shapes different sorts of procedures, social and object interactions. From software for the visual design of industrial products to games for military training, from surveillance cameras to telepresence robots that facilitate multinational corporate meetings, from videos that guide the bodily movements of people learning a new recipe on the Internet to self-tracking devices that allow for performance control, film technologies have become ubiquitous. In other words, in order to understand the present state of tacit cinematic knowledge, we also need to understand how film entered into a variety of realms of practices, which are at first sight unrelated to film in its cinematic context.\nThe international conference \u201cHistories of Tacit Cinematic Knowledge\u201dinvites scholars to further theorize and historicize \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d in its different configurations. Specific questions to be addressed include: What is the unnoticed part of cinematic knowledge in the production of scientific evidence? How do techniques and templates from film affect architectural design, musical composition, or sports performance? How do modes of circulation and formats of film reshape human and non-human interactions and what types of political action do they inconspicuously give rise to? How does \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d create inequalities through processes of colonizing, and of gendering societies, or what is the potential of \u201ctacit cinematic knowledge\u201d in opposing institutional discrimination? What impact do configurations of film beyond the cinema have on economies of production, distribution, and consumption? How do film-based technologies inform policies of security and regulate the circulation of people? How do filmic procedures generate affect and emotions in areas that apparently have nothing to do with film?\nWe welcome contributions from all scientific fields, including sociology, anthropology, architecture, literature, musicology, educational sciences, neurosciences, engineering and technology studies, theatre, film and media studies. We are especially interested in papers that engage with the following topics:\nTacit Cinematic Knowledge and:\nPlease send 250\u2013300word abstracts and a brief biographical note to 2020tacit@gmail.comby January 15, 2020.

It is part of everyday life, informing how we treat ourselves, family, friends, strangers, animals, and the environment.\u00a0Care\u00a0can look like many things: from animal welfare organisations that span the globe to taking\u00a0care\u00a0of elderly populations, volunteering for youth organisations, coaching sports teams, planting a tree, raising children, teaching, defending the innocent, even standing in picket lines around abortion clinics\u2014or defending those who need to walk past them\u2014designing green architecture, donating clothing and time at refugee centres, and more. In fact,\u00a0care\u00a0underpins broad discourses of politics, law, ethics, health and media in contemporary society.\n\u00a0\nToday\u2019s world is seeing a rise in ideologies that seem opposed to the basic concept of\u00a0care, and yet alongside these rhetorics we see instances, events, and entire movements dedicated to\u00a0caring\u00a0for others. Even the recent political uprisings in Lebanon and Turkey could be said to spring from a place of\u00a0care; human rights and choices about basic lifestyles are certainly encapsulated by the concept of\u00a0care, and they are at the core of such movements. Around the world, donations to charities of all kinds easily top $500 billion annually. And while cash can sometimes be an easy way to\u00a0care, not requiring much more than a push of a button, our daily lives are filled with\u00a0care\u00a0in one form or another.\n\u00a0\nIn the context of the\u00a0caring\u00a0professions specifically,\u00a0care\u00a0is an umbrella term that subsumes policies, institutions, and a comprehensive work force of professions and occupations, and can be both \u2018hands on\u2019 and administrative. Importantly, health\u00a0care\u00a0also carries connotations of attitudes, ideologies, cultural values and community expectations that are implicated, not always harmoniously, in the dynamics of modern health\u00a0care\u00a0systems. While health\u00a0care\u00a0systems are concerned with the provision of services, the broad social domain of health\u00a0care\u00a0practices involves, equally significantly, the consumption of such services and the beliefs and activities of patients and clients.\n\u00a0\nWhat makes a human being show\u00a0care? What is the appropriate way to show\u00a0care? What factors cause a person to show more or less\u00a0care? To what extent is\u00a0care\u00a0intertwined with personal sacrifice? Is\u00a0care\u00a0valued, promoted and properly compensated? Is it possible to\u00a0care\u00a0too much? Is there a limit to how much a person should\u00a0care? Is anyone not worthy of receiving\u00a0care? What would happen if the ethos of\u00a0care\u00a0were applied to everyday life and critical decision-making?\n\u00a0\nFrom the conversations and dialogues which take place, our intention is to form a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nIn recognition of the complexities of questions around\u00a0care, the interdisciplinary project on\u00a0Care\u00a0aims to provide a springboard for participants to engage in dialogues that explore not only the concept of\u00a0care\u00a0within the specific context of the health and wellness profession, but also how\u00a0care\u00a0(or lack thereof) impacts other professions, practices, and life experiences. The project organisers welcome proposals for presentations on any aspect of\u00a0Care, including:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat To Send\nThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

This year the conference is open to PhD\u00a0students, researchers and scholars interested in the topic of literary and linguistic enigmas\u00a0from a broader historical and socio-cultural perspective.\nThis year\u2019s conference grounds its interest in the enigma in the acknowledgment of two\u00a0opposite forces, in both every-day and literary language, which drive written and oral\u00a0communication: one of them aims at clarity and straightforwardness, the other at obscurity\u00a0and ambiguity. These two tensions cause different formal approaches even in relation to the\u00a0same discourse referent.\nIn his paper published in the \u00abAsino d\u2019oro\u00bb (1991), Fortini problematizes the notions of\u00a0obscurity and complexity placing them at the extremities of the same formal segment.\u00a0According to him, the difference between obscurity and complexity lies on the nature of\u00a0\u201cdarkness\u201d, which \u00abcannot and must ever not be [\u2026] \u2018won\u2019 or \u2018overcome\u2019 since its raison\u00a0d\u2019\u00eatre lies in being [\u2026] a particular kind of \u2018figure of speech\u2019\u00bb. In fact, complexity implies at\u00a0least one chance of effectively decoding the hidden meaning.\u00a0The enigma falls into the category of complexity. The term \u201cenigma\u201d generally identifies\u00a0the whole literary process which, directly or indirectly, poses a question, whose solution is\u00a0key to access the deepest meaning of the texts. Thus, in its final shape, the enigma calls for\u00a0a kind of literature which welcomes complexity and uses it to conceal its meaning, whose\u00a0existence is thus implicitly taken for granted.\u00a0Even when written as a polysemous sentence with an autonomous \u2013 though often\u00a0paradoxical \u2013 meaning, the enigma always poses to the addressee the challenge of\u00a0overcoming conventional interpretations and readings. This can be possible through the\u00a0reduction of the manifold elements of the enigma to few words, among which the revealing\u00a0one must be identified. However, this process is not as straightforward as it may seem since\u00a0the enigma prioritizes the performative function of language over its communicative one.\u00a0Lastly, the enigma always issues a challenge between who holds knowledge and who aims\u00a0at acquiring it. This intrinsic hierarchical asymmetry can finally be altered by the addressee,\u00a0as soon as s/he finds the solution and thus gains access to the addresser\u2019s cultural \u00e9lite.\n?\nSubmissions related to the following areas of interest are welcomed: Ancient Greek and\u00a0Latin, Romance, Italian, English and French literature and philology; History of Language\u00a0and Linguistics; Comparative Literature and Theory of Literature. Paper proposals should\u00a0be related to one of the following macro-areas:\n? THE SUBJECT OF THE ENIGMA\nFrom the Eighties onwards, thematology has opened new research paths in literature studies.\u00a0By prioritizing contextualization, it has helped analyze the subjects presented by enigmas\u00a0within a broader historical and socio-cultural framework as well as reduce the risk of creating\u00a0thematic catalogues based on sterile content-related criteria. The goal of this Conference is\u00a0thus to highlight those links between the content of the enigma and the context from which\u00a0it derives and by which is influenced both from a synchronic and/or diachronic perspective.\u00a0Comparisons between different historical and cultural periods are highly appreciated.\u00a0Are there any signs of continuity in the development of the themes related to the enigma\u00a0over time, ideally from Sophocle\u2019s to Bola\u00f1o\u2019s? Are there any variations in the themes\u00a0mentioned in enigmas which mirror broader socio-cultural changes? Which literary genres\u00a0have included the highest number of enigmas and in which historical period? Have coeval\u00a0authors produced enigmas antithetical in content? If so, why?\u00a0This macro-area aims to analyze the declensions of the subjects related to the enigma\u00a0within a broad historical and socio-cultural framework, which ranges from ancient times to\u00a0close contemporaneity.\n? THE GENRE AND FORM OF THE ENIGMA\nThe notions of literary genre, style and language can be useful means to examine how an\u00a0enigma can assume different forms, or masterplots. Such formal variations may affect the\u00a0whole structure of the texts, as in the case of the development of a specific literary genre, or\u00a0only some of its components (its style or language), as in the case of the use of a given figure\u00a0of speech, metrical structure, or lexical relation between the title and the text of a poetical\u00a0composition.\u00a0This macro-area aims to analyze the different forms the enigma can assume over time,\u00a0especially from the point of view of its literary genre, style and language.\n? THE RECEPTION OF THE ENIGMA\nReception is the essence of any enigma and it thus significantly influences its formulation,\u00a0especially in terms of genre, form and theme. However, the complexity of the code\u00a0underlying the enigma affects the width of its audience. When the enigma is channeled\u00a0through an accessible code, it attracts a large audience, as in the case of puzzle magazines,\u00a0detective or noir novels. On the contrary, the enigma attracts a narrower audience when it us\u00a0characterized by a more exclusive code. This choice may be caused by either extrinsic or\u00a0intrinsic reasons: the former may aim to avoid censure, the latter to create an intellectual\u00a0challenge with the addressee. However, enigmas can also be unsolved. An enigma can be\u00a0referred to as unsolved, though still solvable, when the key to its code is missing. On the\u00a0contrary, the enigma can be referred to as unsolvable when its key does not exist, probably\u00a0because of an either intended or accidental internal contradiction in the formulation of\u00a0enigma itself.\u00a0This macro-area aims to analyze the reception of the enigma, in particular the relation\u00a0between addresser and addressee and the accessibility of the code characterizing the enigma\u00a0from a historical, political, cultural and linguistic point of view.\nThe Conference will be held in Padua on 21-22 May 2020 and will host the following keynote\u00a0speakers:\nStefano Bartezzaghi (IULM)\nFederico Bertoni (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nSalvatore Monda (Universit\u00e0 del Molise)\nChristelle Reggiani (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9)\nPAPER SUBMISSION\nAll submissions must be written either in Italian or English and sent as PDF documents to\u00a0convegnoenigma.unipd@gmail.com.

These protests were fuelled by the deterioration of the social, political and environmental situation in Europe and the rest of the world, as well as by citizens\u2019 increasing demands for social, political and environmental justice.\nThroughout history, various acts of civil disobedience, revolutions and uprisings have taken place in Europe and its surroundings. Yet the recent increase of protests coincides with the development of new technologies, as well as social media and artistic movements, which have led to the emergence of innovative forms of activism. They have allowed voices from a broader spectrum of society to be heard. Protests have become more accessible to segments of society, which have been traditionally excluded from socio-political debates, such as minorities, undocumented migrants, LGBTQIA, women, young people or vegans. These groups also bring new demands to the table: in addition to the more traditional claims of protest movements, such as better working conditions, there are now calls for other considerations including gender equality, transgender rights, decolonising measures and environmental protection. This is complemented by a growing awareness of how various mechanisms of exclusion and disenfranchisement may intersect, followed by a call for new types of alliances and forms of solidarity.\nWhat are the impacts of protests on European politics? How do the developments of new technologies affect protest movements? How does the inclusion of diverse social categories influence demands for change? How do contemporary protest movements reimagine solidarity between various groups? How does artistic creativity contribute to activism? To what extent does the history of protest movements in Europe shape the new generation of activists? What is the relationship between past, present and future protests? The conference wishes to address these and other related questions in response to the changing voices of activism and protest across Europe.\nWe invite contributions from academic as well as non-academic backgrounds; these may include Political Sciences, Economics, History, European Studies, Law, Languages, Literature, Art, and Natural and Life Sciences. Topics may include but are not limited to:\nClaims and causes: Feminism and gender politics, post-colonialism and decolonial movements, anti-racist struggles, environmental and food activism, identity and citizenship, workers\u2019 rights, equality and social rights movements, etc.Actors and agents: Young people, students, academic engagement, minorities, migrants, hacktivists, artists, etc.Means and media: Technology and social media, the arts (visual, written, spoken), demonstrations, flash mobs, sit-ins, etc.\nAs a centre run by a steering committee of postgraduates, we particularly encourage postgraduates and early career researchers to apply. Moreover, in light of this year\u2019s conference theme, we also encourage activists to apply, so as to feature both academic and practical perspectives.

The project involves blasting or removing reefs, rapids, and shoals that encumber or endanger navigation of large cargo ships, particularly during the dry season, and eventually dredging and building dikes in order to turn the river into a smooth-flowing canal. After an interruption of several years, the project is currently being revived, in spite of opposition by NGOs and policy makers, particularly in Laos and Thailand, on the grounds of its potential negative impacts on environmental and social sustainability.\u00a0\nThe Dialogue on China\u2019s Upper Mekong Navigation Improvement Project will gather selected experts in order to discuss the legal, political, economic, social, security, and environmental impacts of this project on riverine countries.\nThe Dialogue will take place on 15 May 2020, in Mae Fah Luang University, during half a day. Each speaker will present his/her paper for 30 minutes, followed by questions and answers. The papers will be published in a special issue of the ARCID Working Papers. Copyright will be retained by the author and publication of the working paper with ARCID will not pre-empt him/her from publishing the revised paper elsewhere.\nSelected speakers will be offered a compensation package for their participation in the symposium. This package includes:\n- Air transportation to Chiang Rai from anywhere in Thailand (or from elsewhere, up to a maximum of 4,000 THB per person for a round trip ticket).- Local transportation in Chiang Rai during two days.- Two-night (14 and 15 May) accommodation at the Wanasom Resort, near the venue of the Dialogue (http://www.wanasom.com).- Honorarium in cash of 2,500 THB.\nInterested speakers should submit an abstract of their proposed paper to ignasi.rib@mfu.ac.th as soon as possible, including a short bio, affiliation, and contact information.

All different, yet all abuse.\n\u00a0\nThe effects of such abuse are profound. It can undermine relationships and cause both physical pain and psychological distress. Consistently, increased health risks and specific negative behaviours have been found to be associated with a history of abuse in individuals. Research focused on adverse childhood experiences by the Adverse Childhood Exposure (ACE) Study (Felitti et al, 1998) posits that there is a strong and graded relationship between ten different adverse childhood experiences, including emotional and physical neglect and sexual and physical abuse, with risk factors for death and disease.\n\u00a0\nWhat are the bigger questions regarding abuse?\u00a0 What causes one to abuse?\u00a0 What are the experiences of those who are abused?\u00a0 What about those with limited or no voice?\u00a0 How do systems of abuse affect the greater community? What connection is there between abuse and resilience?\u00a0 What happens when abuse goes unchecked?\u00a0 This project endeavours to explore abuse in its many forms across a range of critical, contextual, and cultural perspectives. Seeking to encourage innovative dialogues, we warmly welcome papers and projects that demonstrate the struggle to understand abuse and its impact on the individual, familial, cultural, community, and global level.\n\u00a0\nThis conference has a global focus; it aims to facilitate dialogue and spark innovative collaborations and discussions at the international level. We welcome papers from all disciplines, professions and vocations, going beyond the academic world and bringing together researchers, community, and professionals engaged in work on Abuse.\u00a0 We welcome traditional papers, panels or round tables, and workshop proposals, as well as other forms of presentation platforms (art, poetry, posters, video submissions, etc.) favoured outside academia, given the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, recognising that different groups express themselves in various formats and mediums.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nSubject to the presentations and discussions which take place at the meeting, there is a possibility for a selective innovative publication to emerge with the aim of engendering further interdisciplinary collaboration and discussion.\n\u00a0\nWe welcome proposals from a wide range of perspectives and voices, on topics including but not limited to:\n\u00a0\nWhat To Send\nThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops,\u00a0storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

However,\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0is seldom a black and white matter. Exposing secrets can be instrumental in achieving positive change; but at the same time, such disclosures may run the risk of endangering innocent lives. Affording\u00a0whistleblowers\u00a0protection whilst also providing natural justice to those accused of wrongdoing can be a difficult balance to maintain. While\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0empowers those who are generally without power, it could also contribute to the creation of a culture of surveillance and reporting that undermines positive engagement between colleagues, employees and citizens.\n\u00a0\nAs a complex, fundamentally polarizing concept,\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0can take many forms, from hourly workers informing bosses about unsafe working conditions, to high-end employees at international corporations informing the public about health risks, to anonymous informants disclosing illegal practices at the highest levels of governments around the world.\n\u00a0\nIn one of the earliest examples of\u00a0whistleblowing, two American naval officers in 1777-78 accused the Commander in Chief of the Continental Navy of torturing British prisoners of war. The Continental Congress dismissed the Commander in Chief and covered the naval officers\u2019 defense costs in a subsequent libel suit. The Continental Congress also enacted a law declaring it the duty of persons living or serving in the United States to inform Congress or another proper authority of misconduct, frauds, or misdemeanours committed by a person in the service of the states.\n\u00a0\nFast forward to today, and Wikileaks is the largest\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0operation in the modern era, made possible because of technological advances in knowledge-sharing. The disclosures on WikiLeaks have been enormous in terms of their reach and volume, and have prompted a worldwide cultural conversation about the relationship between national security and individual privacy. The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, is currently imprisoned, and the focus of differing views on the legality of extraditing him to the USA. WikiLeaks provided a platform for very many\u00a0whistleblowers, such as Chelsea Manning who disclosed classified military documents and served seven years, commuted from 35 years, for espionage. Edward Snowden lives in exile, in Moscow, with the right to asylum, after also leaking classified documents to journalists about government security operations whilst working for the CIA. Such figures have become household names, partly because of the rise of internet platforms which make it impossible to keep the cases under wraps, and partly because they tap into our deepest desires, to be kept safe from threats and harm, and our deepest fears about the power of states and their capacity for operating global surveillance for their own ends.\n\u00a0\nAll of this raises the question of how we got to the point where individuals who expose wrongdoing are themselves the recipients of punishment, and this has of late become even more pressing as events around the world expose the underside of global machinations. Revelations by\u00a0whistleblowers\u00a0lay bare the details of US President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, foreign interference in the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on leaving the European Union, corrupt dealings by Crown Casino in Melbourne, Australia and countless other cases.\n\u00a0\nIt is an appropriate time to reconsider the meaning and implications of\u00a0whistleblowing. What conditions give rise to and sustain\u00a0whistleblowing? What purposes does\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0serve in a democratic society? What lessons are to be gained from case studies in terms of the possibilities of achieving change by working within a system, working outside a system, working alone or as part of a collective that may or may not be organised? How can societies harness the benefits of\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0as a form of extreme civic engagement while preserving the values of justice and fairness, and protecting the rights of relevant parties? What are the rules of engagement for\u00a0blowing\u00a0the\u00a0whistle\u00a0on and dealing with\u00a0whistleblowers?\n\u00a0\nFrom the conversations and dialogues which take place, our intention is to form a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nIn recognition of the complex, inter-disciplinary nature of this topic, our unique, interdisciplinary conference provides a platform for participants from any relevant field, profession or practice to engage in dialogues on any aspect of\u00a0whistleblowing\u00a0including:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat To Send\nThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

Once these cultural power shapers created the form,\u00a0fashion\u00a0photography took on a life of its own and became\u2014perhaps always was\u2014art. This art form has since been elevated to heights such that being a\u00a0fashion\u00a0photographer can be seen as very important chapter in many well-known photographers\u2019 career: designers rely on them; models request them; magazines use their work: celebrities choose them for shoots; and the power they have to represent others is beyond compare in today\u2019s, 21st century image-driven world.\n\u00a0\nFollowing our first\u00a0Fashion\u00a0and Photography conference in Palermo in 2018, we are further broadening the interdisciplinary mix and range of potential discussions and activities. Whether dance, theatre, drama theory, directing or performance practice, the different aspects of the performing arts will be explored and developed alongside previous discussions, especially with the new challenges of technology along with the changes in audiences and performers in the 21st century.\n\u00a0\nOur\u00a0Fashion\u00a0and Photography: 2nd Global Inclusive Interdisciplinary event will examine the dynamics of all these (and related) fields. In a world which is experiencing the transforming realities of globalization, with people engaging at all levels and in diverse ways, the intersections and engagements created at the interface of all the modes of representation involved in these areas and activities are paramount. They involve cultural, social, commercial, artistic, financial, and political issues, and from the bottom to the top can determine power relations, careers, sexual norms and deviance, and more.\n\u00a0\nWe live in a period of so-called hyper-consumption which encourages individuals to consume for their own personal pleasure. Fast\u00a0fashion, trends in sustainable and recyclable\u00a0fashion, the rise of performance\u00a0fashion\u00a0and\u00a0fashion\u00a0as performance art\u00a0 denotes a society now defined by movement, fluidity, and flexibility. Performance from ballet to theatre, the catwalk to festivals, is increasingly oriented towards pleasure and satisfaction, a fleeting hedonism which quickly changes focus. The experience is mixed with tensions, conflicts, and even anxiety. The uncertainties and fears of 21st century living are reflected in\u00a0fashion, performance and all forms of visual representations.\n\u00a0\nThis conference aims to consider ways in which we can re-imagine our practices in relation to others, our history, and the environment with a view to forming a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further collaboration and discussion, whilst also continuing the evolution of the project.\n\u00a0\nUnlike other conferences or gatherings, our event proposes to step outside the traditional conference setting and offer opportunities for photographers, designers, practitioners, theorists, independent scholars, academics, performers, writers, and others to intermingle, providing platforms for interdisciplinary interactions that are fruitful and conducive to broadening horizons and sparking future projects, collaborations, and connections.\n\u00a0\nWe are excited to accept proposals for presentations, displays, exhibits, round tables, panels, interactive workshops and more.

This conference has a historical and critical perspective about immersion by considering that it draws both on state of the art technologies and on old and discontinued media that have once stimulated and expanded our perception. While these technologies (from stereo views to cinema, virtual reality or video gaming) have deeply strengthened the human relationship to virtual worlds, they have also made visual documents more engaging, triggering richer and more inspiring interpretations of reality. Noteworthy is also the fact that some of these technologies are being used and considered vital to reshape our perception of heritage and to allow new readings and museological experiences of historical collections.\u00a0\nThe conference will take place in Lisbon, at the facilities of Universidade Lus\u00f3fona (Campo Grande) and in Goleg\u00e3, at the Carlos Relvas Studio House, a stunning 19th-century photographic studio, absolutely unique in the world and extremely well-preserved.\nThe organizing committee invites scholars, researchers, artists, curators and archivists to submit a proposal for a paper presentation addressing one or more of the following themes:\n\u00a0\n1- Stereoscopic Photography and its Visual Cultures (19th to 21st Century);\n2- Photography, Cinema and Sound Media Archaeologies;\n3- Scientific and Social History of Early Immersive Media;\u00a0\n4- 3D Cinema, Virtual Reality and Video Gaming;\n5- Media Arts (Visual/Sound) and Immersion;\n6- Urban Sound Studies;\n7- Performance and Visual Media;\n8- Cultural Heritage and Digital Age;\nStereoscopic projection will be available at the conference. The conference will offer you the opportunity to present your talk in 3-D if you feel inclined to. The digital images for these 3D presentations will be expected by April 18, 2020.\u00a0\nThe conference will also include 3D film screenings. 3D film submissions are due by May 15, 2020.\u00a0\nApplicants will have the opportunity to submit their papers for publishing to the International Journal on Stereo & Immersive Media (https://revistas.ulusofona.pt/index.php/stereo/issue/archive).\nThis conference is organized by the Early Visual Media Lab from the Research Center CICANT, Universidade Lus\u00f3fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, Lisbon.\u00a0\n\n http://stereoimmersivemedia.ulusofona.pt\n\n\n victor.flores@ulusofona.pt\n\n"}, {"title": "Creating a Transnational Space in First Year Writing", "location": "N/A", "organization": "NA", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-07-22", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2019-12-17", "description": "This CFP is for a forthcoming book about enacting transnational pedagogical practice in freshman composition courses.

Many of these students are entering institutions and first-year-writing programs that still function under monolingual ideology. Suresh Canagarajah defines this monolingual space as a place where \u201cthe language [is] capable of naturally expressing only the values and thoughts belonging to [one specific] community\u201d (Canagarajah)*. That is to say, many universities have yet to adopt a writing program that encourages the expression of values and thoughts of their transnational students but instead continue to see their classrooms as a \u201cmonolingual\u201d space. Some writing programs have attempted to foster self-reflection pedagogy that addresses our students\u2019 unique socio-linguistic context. Assignments in first-year-writing are meant to encourage the reflection of transnational space where the exchange of ideas and resources supersede barriers of language and structural borders. These are meant to demonstrate to the students the value of their complex translingual and transnational rhetorical ecology.\nIn this book, I would like to discuss the successes and shortcomings of these FYW assignments in meeting the needs of our students and offer insights to other writing programs who seek to incorporate pedagogy that addresses the values of such intersections of cultures, languages, and people.\u00a0\n*Canagarajah, A.

After several years of rotation between UMass and Binghamton University, in 2019 the graduate students of Kent State hosted an installment. As the conference returns to UMass for 2020, the aim is to foster dialogue between translators, interpreters, and researchers at the graduate level on ethical issues in our field.\nWe welcome abstracts and panel proposals related to the topics of ethics and justice, pertaining to any subfield of translation and interpreting studies, including literary, technical, and legal translation; theory and practice of interpretation; translation history; and translation and interpreting technology. Possible themes include (but are not limited to): interpretation and migrant justice; the ethics and ideological implications of translation choices (both in terms of what we translate and how we go about it); translation as activism; translators\u2019 and interpreters\u2019 agency; community interpretation, family interpretation, and other pro bono modes of interpreting; ethics of medical interpreting; ethical and economic impact of machine translation; corporate translation and accountability; considerations relating to identity and subjectivity; translating cultural difference; nationalism and cosmopolitanism; translation pedagogy; access to translation and interpreting services; politics of literary translation; publishing and visibility; gendered disparities in the profession; and so forth. We welcome comparative studies, case studies, corpus studies and other quantitative approaches, argumentative essays, and any other methodology relevant to translation and interpreting studies.\nThe Graduate Translation Conference will serve as a forum that exhibits the robust relationship of translation and its broader applications in other academic disciplines.

We propose to move beyond these frameworks to see landscapes as embodied modes of habitation and of human and non-human encounters with the land in which ongoing processes of acting in and with the world take place. By focusing on processes of encounter, occupation, and mediation, we also seek to redefine \u201cland\u201d more broadly, for example on human interactions with natural, social, and imagined worlds, or alternate -scapes such as waterscapes, bodyscapes, technoscapes, mediascapes, cyberscapes, etc.\nTaiwan has long been a compelling site of ecological heterogeneity, cultural multiplicities, and geopolitical contestation. Its landscapes embody the complex interactions and negotiations between the different waves of human occupation and their environment. With its natural and cultural diversities, Taiwan becomes a productive site for the theorization of land/scaping as an epistemological shift from landscape (noun) to landscape (verb). Land/scaping as a critical concept beyond the confines of existing representations unfolds the heuristic potential for remapping both Taiwan and Taiwan Studies. Such methodological reframing brings to the fore the tension between the notion of perspective\u2014its formation, translation, and reconfiguration\u2014and the interlocking web of land(s), landscape(s) and landscaping.\nHow have the different modes of land/scaping in and of Taiwan been formed, revealed, effaced, shaped and altered? How have notions such as Formosa/Taiwan and Taiwan(ese)/non-Taiwan(ese) been (re)defined in these land/scaping processes? How have the different approaches to land/scaping influenced the way Taiwan is seen, heard, felt, and communicated? We invite contributions that address these questions across disciplinary perspectives.\n\u00a0\nPotential topics may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Place-making and identity (re)formation (such as gender, ethnicity, etc.)\n\u2022 Floating or changing space/place; the rural/urban\n\u2022 Temporality of landscape; sites of memory; remains/ruins\n\u2022 Emotions, flows of affect; collective trauma/social suffering\n\u2022 Work, labor, human body, and embodied experiences; collective agency\n\u2022 Land ownership, land problems, land justice\n\u2022 Technology and knowledge production of nature and land\n\u2022 Mediascape, cultural genres, generic landscape\n\u2022 Environmental humanities and environmental studies; human and non-human interactions (air, land, water, energy, animals)\n\u00a0\nWe welcome cross-disciplinary approaches (e.g., between literature, film, geography, environmental studies, anthropology, archaeology, history, urban studies, architecture, art history, performance studies). We especially encourage junior scholars (PhD candidates, postdocs, adjunct and non-tenured faculty) to submit proposals.\nParticipants will be expected to pre-circulate, read, and discuss substantive works-in-progress, such as dissertation/manuscript chapters or journal articles. If there is group interest, a special journal issue can be organized and proposed from the workshop papers.\nTwo nights of local accommodation and meals will be provided for all participants. Additional limited travel funding may be available to subsidize domestic airfare for those without funding support from their home institutions.\nPlease send a 300-word abstract and a brief (1-2 paragraph) academic biography as a single PDF file to twscapes@uw.edu by December 21, 2019.

In its turn, the IoT advent has determined the proliferation of smart devices connected to the Internet and injecting into it a vast amount of data that may traverse several network boundaries and undergo many computational stages before they get consumed. If, on the one hand, the benefits brought by these technologies are well known, it is clear as well that, in the envisaged scenario, the exposure of data, services and infrastructures to malicious attacks has definitely grown. Even a single breach on any of the links of the data-service-infrastructure chain may seriously compromise the security of the end-user application. With such a wide attack surface, security must definitely approached in a holistic way and addressed in any layer where concerns may potentially arise.\u00a0\nThe workshop solicits novel and innovative ideas, proposals, positions and best practices that address the modelling, design, implementation, and enforcement of the security in Cloud/Edge/IoT environments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTOPICS:\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\n- Blockchain-based tools and services\n- Data security across multiple domains and countries\n- Federated IoT, Edge and Cloud systems\n- Security in Osmotic Computing\n- Security on Cyber-physical systems\n- Anonymous and certified communications\u00a0\n- Metrics and performance of secure interdomain protocols\n- Attack detection and prevention\n- Authentication protocols and key management\n- Availability and survivability of secure services and systems\n- Biometric security\n- Trust models and security modeling in Cloud/Edge/IoT scenarios\n- Security and privacy in the cloud and fog/edge infrastructure, services and storage\n- Machine learning applied to security applications\n- Emerging and disruptive technologies for security, privacy, trust and forensics\n- Security systems and protocols for Drones\n- Drone communication and communication security\n- Security in e-health\n- Security in Smart cities\n- Security in Networks including SDN\n\u00a0\nThe use of Soft Computing/Computational Intelligence methods in facing problems in the above topics is highly welcome, although not compulsory.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPAPER SUBMISSION:\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\nAuthors are invited to submit their papers written in English in IEEE double-column format (IEEE standard conference templates).

On an individual level, there are many motivations behind the pilgrim experience where identity aspects such as religious affiliation, spiritual beliefs, tradition or mere curiosity play an important role. In recent years, the cultural industries and tourism industries have also developed sophisticated strategies in order to reach new audiences and gain market share. Content producers have obtained the sponsorship of national agencies in order to develop their products as a way of reinforcing National Branding. National agencies focused on tourism and development have found that representations of cultural heritage through fictional media positively impacts tourism through these Media Pilgrimages (also referred to as Content Tourism or Media Tourism), and media representations become a relevant tool for regional development.\u00a0\nThe aim of the symposium was born from two ideas which correspond with relevant pillars of modern East Asian economies but also to many post-industrial societies. The first is the common cultural background of East Asian countries like Japan, Korea or China. These commonalities have made possible the rise of economic and cultural transnational flows which include as a main vortex pilgrimage destinations. The second, corresponding to a more contemporary shared meaning, is the consequence of the relevance of creative and cultural industries and their influence on the collective global imagination.\nWith this purpose, graduate students, scholars, independent researchers, and industry practitioners are invited to submit papers and presentations for this workshop. Contributions on the following topics or related areas will be specially considered:\n?\nWe are delighted to confirm that Dr Craig Norris (University of Tasmania) and Dr Eriko Kawanishi (Kyoto University) will be keynote speakers for the Workshop.\u00a0\nMore suggestions in relation to these contents or different discussion boards related to these topics, will be welcome.\n\u00a0\nProposals should be sent by the web form on the website by the\u00a030th November 2019\nPlease submit your paper proposal here:\u00a0https://www.mutualimages.org/2020-workshop\u00a0\nQuestions about the event can be directly addressed to the Organising Committee at\u00a0japanpilgrimages2020@gmail.com\u00a0\n\n https://www.mutualimages.org/2020-workshop\n\n\n japanpilgrimages2020@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "The General and the Particular in the Contemporary World.

Are there universal values and rules that can be declared binding for all people worldwide, in all cultures, religions and societies? Or should we regard particularism and cultural relativism following the achievements of postcolonial theories as an opportunity for the co-existence of different worldviews, languages, cultures and denominations? Is there a universalism existent beyond all the cultural particularisms? And can particularisms assert themselves without being in relation to a universal measurement? How do we understand the problem of good and evil in the world? What are the local, national and international implications of identity politics on the left and on the right? How can we overcome the theoretical juxtaposition of universalism and particularism without either asserting an absolute or accepting a sort of postmodern \u2018anything goes\u2019? The philosopher, ethnologist and sociologist Lawrence Krader (1919\u20131998) devoted himself to these questions in various published and unpublished writings (for more information visit the homepage of the Krader Archive at Mills library at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, lawrencekrader.com). The planned conference seeks to shed light on these issues from his and other perspectives and aims to tackle this question by means of describing and analyzing concrete historical, empirical, political, economic, ethical and aesthetic debates. We invite scholars from various disciplines to take up this question and address it from the viewpoint of their research fields, including topics such as human rights and theories of recognition, cultural relativism and postcolonialism, research on ethnic, cultural, religious and other minorities, multiculturalism, theories and concepts of deviance, federalism, centralism and the diaspora, international alliances and national aspirations, free trade and protectionism, gender binary coherence, queer theories and gender fluidity, diplomacy and belligerency, civil liberties and political correctness, applied ethics, questions such as genetic research, animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, the death penalty etc., aesthetics and art in theory and concepts. We are interested in papers which do not simply plead one side of an issue but take up the various sides of the debate on these issues, if critically. This conference respects sharp intellectual debate on these important issues. Ideally, we are hoping to foster a debate about the debate bringing together speakers from a variety of perspectives to argue over universalism and particularism as they manifest themselves in our world today and their significance for the future. The conference papers will be published in an edited volume.\n\u00a0\nWe will be inviting successful applicants to participate in the conference on the basis of abstracts (200-300 words in length) submitted before the end of the calendar year 2019 to the following members of the Krader Project:\n\u00a0\nProf. Rob Beamish\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 rob.beamish@queensu.ca\nProf. Cyril Levitt\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 levittc@mcmaster.ca\nDr. Sabine Sander\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sandes1@mcmaster.ca\n\u00a0\nSuccessful applicants will be informed of the decision by January 31, 2020 and will have their travel costs and room and board covered by the Lawrence Krader Research Project.

In Althussarian terms we might say that we are persistently interpellated, or hailed into positions of listening subjects in society, requiring us to engage in or with the cultural assumptions and techniques that those listening positions entail. But listening may also represent a capacity for agency. In her cultural history of modern life, Jane Bennett has suggested that listening is a key component of agency, of our capacity to affect the world around us. And in Sonic Agency: Sound and Emergent Forms of Resistance, Brandon LaBelle, elaborates upon this idea, stating that to listen is \u201cto perceive the every-changing relations in which the self is always embedded.\u201d As LaBelle proceeds to explore a series of sonic figures, he outlines a complex roster of listening modalities, demonstrating, in the process, that \u201cthe relational affordances of listening\u201d may include care, intensity, freedom, collectivity, direct action, and activism. The SpokenWeb Symposium invites papers from a broad range of disciplinary and methodological approaches that reflect upon the relationship between our three keywords: Listening, Sound, and Agency.\nWe invite you to submit proposals for papers that consider the implications of our key terms in relation to such themes and fields as: communities of sound and listening, politics and ethics, literature and poetics, performance, pedagogy, disciplinary methodologies and cultural techniques, media and material history, disability, archives and collections, sound art and installations, oral history and storytelling, indigenous communities and practices, among others.\nCONFIRMED PLENARY SPEAKERSMara Mills (New York University)\nJonathan Sterne (McGill University)\nINSTRUCTIONSIndividual papers will be between 15-20 minutes in presentation length.

The essays will address TV dramas and comedies aired during the Golden Age of TV, continuing through peak and prestige TV. An editor at Lexington Books, a division of Rowman & Littlefield, has expressed interest in this project.\nThe Golden Age of television begins with the Sopranos (1999) and becomes Peak TV or Prestige TV circa 2006. Brought about by the confluence of changing cultural dynamics, bigger and better TVs that enhanced the viewing experience, and new outlets looking for content to distribute, the Golden Age of TV inaugurates a turn towards complex characters, relationship dynamics, and situations that had not played out in living rooms before. In his book Difficult Men, Brett Martin says that the defining characteristic of the Golden Age of TV was its depiction of conflicted and flawed male leads. Despite the morally questionable behavior of Tony Soprano, Omar Little, Walter White, Don Draper, and Dexter Morgan, viewers at least rooted for them even if they could not totally identify with them. This volume seeks contributions that reconsider comedies and dramas from this era in light of the changing social attitudes brought about by cultural upheavals that challenged opportunities for marginalized groups, such as women and people of color in media and on TV. Additionally, these comedies and dramas can be reconsidered in light of more positive and inclusive depictions of men, women, and family in the eras of peak and prestige TV.\nThe eras of peak and prestige TV begin in 2011. The term peak refers both to the proliferation of TV shows airing across new streaming channels (with more scripted TV being produced during this era than ever before) and also the belief that the quality of these shows is better than anything ever produced for TV. This era of TV emphasizes connection over self-actualization, community over individuality, and an uplifting vision of humanity, rejecting the nihilism of the previous era. While not every show is in this era is The Good Place, shows like The Year of Living Biblically, God Friended Me, Sunnyside, and even Russian Doll are brighter in their diagnosis of, and solution to, the human condition. Dan Levy, creator of Schitt\u2019s Creek calls this era of TV \u201cjoyful programming; programming that makes you feel safe, loved and inspired\u201d (Dowling, \u201cEmmys: How \u2018The Good Place,\u2019 \u2018Veep,\u2019 \u2018Russian Doll\u2019 Find Humor in Heightened Realities,\u201d 2019). This volume seeks contributions that tease out the moral messages of shows from this era that seek to explain their moral vision and objectives as well as connect them to the cultural milieu that they arose from.\u00a0\nContributions to the volume will treat TV comedies and dramas as moral artifacts. Authors will investigate the moral vision of these shows individually or comparatively by thinking through the moral meanings and messages they attempt to convey to audiences. Examples can be negative (in the sense of \u2018the audience ought not to\u2019) or positive (\u2018the audience ought to\u2019), and it is certainly possible to read against the implied morality of the show. Overall, the essays in the volume will move the reader through the moral dimensions of these connected, but tonally different, eras of TV by exploring whether (and if so, how) TV is a site of moral learning and conversation.\nChapter proposals are welcome on, but not limited to:\nGuidelines:\u00a0\nPlease send inquiries and 500-word proposals, along with a CV, to Steven Benko and Vance Ricks at better.living.through.tv@gmail.com by January 10.\u00a0 Contributors will be notified by January 31 and completed chapters of 6,000 to 7,000 words will be due June 14, 2020.\n\n better.living.through.tv@gmail.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Snapshot 20/20 Symposium: A Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment", "location": "Raleigh, North Carolina ", "organization": "Organization: Meredith College", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-04-02\r\n                        to 2020-04-05", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-15", "description": "Meredith College is pleased to announce\u00a0Snapshot 20/20, a symposium to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

They can be celebratory or commemorative. They can be festive, merry, and joyous in their celebrations, or (also simultaneously) sombre, solemn, and reflective in their commemorations. They help us mark the calendar, highlight important sociocultural milestones, measure the passage of time, follow the turning of the seasons, and, in so doing, organize life and society.\nThe kinds of holidays are as rich and varied as their contextual diversity. They cover different kinds of seasonal, civic, cultural, and religious concerns, events, and themes. Christmas, for example, is arguably the major and most highly anticipated holiday of the year in most Western countries, combining both sacred and secular ideals and traditions. Chinese New Year (also referred to as Lunar New Year), as another example, is arguably the most significant holiday in the world\u2019s most populous country, fusing ancient customs, myths, and folk religion. Some holidays, moreover, are co-constituted by each of the holiday kinds. Thanksgiving, for instance, is in many respects a seasonal, cultural, religious, and civic holiday. There are also holidays that are formally mandated by the government, such as Christmas Day, New Year\u2019s Day, and Easter (Good Friday/Easter Monday), whilst others are conventionally recognized by society, including Halloween, Valentine\u2019s Day, and St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\nWhether secular or sacred, political or holy, fun or serious, holidays are, what Michael Buckland (2012) would describe as, \u201cdocument-pervaded\u201d. Documentation \u2013 that is, documents and practices with them \u2013 play significant roles in the ways in which holidays are materialized, established, mediated, and experienced. But what exactly are the documents associated with or even constituting holidays?\nThe Proceedings from the Document Academy presents this Call for Papers for a refereed special issue of the journal entitled \u201cDocumenting the Holidays\u201d. This special issue seeks multidisciplinary perspectives, as diverse as the holidays themselves, that address or analyze the documentation of the holidays in a broad sense. It provides a space for critical and experimental research on the documentation of the holidays from scholarship, traditions, and experiences in the arts, humanities, social sciences, education, and natural science, and from diverse fields including information, media, communication, culture, anthropology, feminist, technology, and science studies.\nPossible holidays, with a specific focus on documentation, that could be examined include (but are not limited to) seasonal, religious, cultural, national, civic, military, carnival, ancient/contemporary, and other kinds. The following examples are in no way formal, rigid, or exhaustive; instead, they are only some possible cases for research. They include Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year\u2019s, and Easter, as well as many other formal or informal holidays from both Western and non-Western contexts.\nPossible lines of inquiry into the holidays and documentation to explore include, but are not limited to, broad questions such as:\nThis Call for Papers is open to diverse contributions that concentrate on different aspects of or questions about documentation within holiday contexts. The journal is enthusiastic to receive both conventional and unconventional works that push the limits of format. Invited types of work therefore include:\nThe editors of the \u201cDocumenting the Holidays\u201d special issue and the\u00a0Proceedings from the Document Academy warmly invite all interested authors and creators to submit their works for kind consideration for publication in this special issue.\nSubmission Instructions\nThe deadline for submission of full articles/completed works is 2 April 2020.

Debate continues about the nature and implications of\u00a0violence\u00a0within our societies even as, in the current political moment,\u00a0violence\u00a0continues to define the lives of people around the globe through warfare, protest, political demonstration and discrimination. Although none of this\u00a0violence\u00a0is new, the methods and motivations behind it may nonetheless be novel amidst an internationally harshening political climate that has seen not only actual\u00a0violence\u00a0but frequently the threat of\u00a0violence\u00a0deployed against those in the public eye. Even speech itself has been deployed as a form of\u00a0violence\u00a0as social media platforms offer both anonymity and global reach.\nOur histories are littered with situations where\u00a0violence\u00a0has been argued to be justified, or where it was viewed as culturally acceptable, even praiseworthy. \u2018Just\u2019 wars are but one example, and the most obvious; retaliatory air strikes, honour killings, protections of borders, and even simply fear of others have been deployed as well. Influential authors such as George Orwell and Franz Fanon, among others, have historically advocated for the efficacy of some types of\u00a0violence. Were they right? If so, who within our societies must bear the brunt of this requirement of\u00a0violence\u00a0and what impact does this have on them\u2014and us?\nMeanwhile, our entertainment media glamourises\u00a0violent\u00a0characters\u2014the anti-hero, the mobster, the vigilante\u2014and \u2018if it bleeds it leads\u2019 continues to influence how news is reported. How does this shape our cultural attitudes toward\u00a0violence? What responsibilities does the media have to tackle\u00a0violence\u00a0and what does responsible reporting on\u00a0violence\u00a0look like in the age of easily shared social media?\nWhy has\u00a0violence\u00a0exerted an irresistible hold on the human psyche throughout history? To what extent is\u00a0violence\u00a0a universal phenomenon within societies? What, if any, circumstances make\u00a0violence\u00a0acceptable? What factors cause people to be\u00a0violent? And what can be done by individuals and communities to prevent\u00a0violence?\nKey TopicsOur second global inclusive interdisciplinary\u00a0Violence\u00a0conference invites you to explore these and other questions about\u00a0violence\u00a0and our societies. Subject to the presentations and discussions which take place at the meeting, there is a possibility for a selective publication to emerge with the aim of engendering further interdisciplinary collaboration and discussion.\nWe welcome proposals from a wide range of perspectives and voices, on topics including but not limited to:\n~ Historical attitudes toward\u00a0violence~ Specific instances of\u00a0violence~\u00a0Violence\u00a0and gender~ Media portrayals of\u00a0violence~ Gender or racial depictions of those who commit\u00a0violence~ Racism as an assumed marker of a \u2018violent\u00a0nature\u2019~ Gender differentiation; can women be terrorists?~ Artistic and photographic depictions of\u00a0violence~\u00a0Violent\u00a0protest and dissent~ Hate speech and incitement to\u00a0violence~ State-sanctioned\u00a0violence\u00a0(war, genocide, torture, capital punishment, etc.)~\u00a0Violence\u00a0and power~ How culture encourages / discourages\u00a0violence~\u00a0Violence\u00a0as a political tool~\u00a0Violence\u00a0and the law~ Ecological and environmental\u00a0violence~ Initiatives to prevent\u00a0violence~ Justifiable\u00a0violence~ Retaliatory\u00a0violence~\u00a0Violence\u00a0and reconciliation practices\nThis conference will feature a stream on activism, protest and dissent. Protest has been part of human societies for millennia. Movements such as Black Lives Matter and Me Too offer a powerful reminder of the continued relevance of activism in the 21st century. While these examples of protest share a common DNA with historical civil rights and gender equality movements, activists today operate in a world where digital technology affords particular advantages and disadvantages that have changed how we engage with protest and dissent. We now have constant access to a steady stream of information about dissatisfaction with the state of our world, who is alleged to be responsible for the situation, and who is calling for change. Consequently, it has never been easier for activists to disseminate messages, educate the public and encourage participation by like-minded people.\nSubmissions to this stream may wish to consider, but are not limited to:~ Comparative assessments of protests/movements and activists~ Historical protests/movements and activists~ Repression and restriction of protest~ Art, music, literature, film, television, theatre as activism and protest~ Personal accounts of activism and protest~ Spaces and places of dissent and activism~ Justice, activism and power~\u00a0Violent\u00a0resistance vs. civil disobedience~ Nationalist and separatist movements~ Revolutionary movements~ Activism in an environment of globalisation\nWhat To SendThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged. Please feel free to put forward proposals that you think will get the message across, in whatever form.\nAt the end of the conference we will be exploring ways in which we can develop the discussions and dialogues in new and sustainable inclusive interdisciplinary directions, including research, workshops, publications, public interest days, associations, developing courses etc which will help us make sense of the topics discussed during the meeting. There is an intention, subject to the discussions which emerge during the course of the meeting, to form a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration.\n300 word proposals, presentations, abstracts and other forms of contribution and participation should be submitted by Friday 10th January 2020. Other forms of participation should be discussed in advance with the Organising Chairs.\nAll submissions will be at least double reviewed, under anonymous (blind) conditions, by a global panel drawn from members of the Project Team, The Development Team and the Advisory Board. In practice our procedures usually entail that by the time a proposal is accepted, it will have been triple and quadruple reviewed.\nYou will be notified of the panel\u2019s decision by Friday 24th January 2020.\nIf your submission is accepted for the conference, a full draft of your contribution should be submitted by Friday 1st May 2020.\nAbstracts and proposals may be in Word, RTF or Notepad formats with the following information and in this order:a) author(s), b) affiliation as you would like it to appear in the programme, c) email address, d) title of proposal, e) type of proposal e.g. paper presentation, workshop, panel, film, performance, etc, f) body of proposal, g) up to 10 keywords.\nE-mails should be entitled:\u00a0Violence\u00a02 Submission\nWhere To SendAbstracts should be submitted simultaneously to the Organising Chair and the Project Administrator:\nEmma Craddock:\u00a0emma@progressiveconnexions.netLen Capuli (Project Administrator):\u00a0bratislavaviolence@ progressiveconnexions.net\n\n http://www.progressiveconnexions.net/interdisciplinary-projects/evil/violence/conferences/\n\n\n bratislavaviolence@progressiveconnexions.net\n\n"}, {"title": "Materials Science Conferences (no)", "location": "Paris, France", "organization": "Organization: Peers Alley Media", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-03-26\r\n                        to 2020-03-27", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-02-25", "description": "Peers Alley Media meetings would like to invite all the outstanding researchers, professionals, research scholars, industrialists, scientists, academicians, young researchers, Business delegates and students from all around the world to attend Euro Materials Science Congress from March 26-27, 2020 in Paris, France.\nThis conference gives an unparalleled opportunity to network with colleagues and learn from the different leaders in Materials Science research.\nThis conference makes a perfect platform for global networking as it brings together the, academicians, renowned speakers, professors, scientists, educationalists, researchers and students across the globe to a most exciting, exceptional, memorable scientific leading event to report and witness the latest scientific achievements in Materials Science.\n\n https://materialsscience.peersalleyconferences.com/\n\n\n materialsscience@meetingsengage.com\n\n"}, {"title": "Camp/camp: the collision of style and biopolitics Grad Student Conference (22nd Annual Graduate Student Conference)", "location": "Western University, London, Ontario, Canada", "organization": "Organization: Comparative Literature, Theory &amp; Criticism, and Hispanic Studies", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-03-26\r\n                        to 2020-03-28", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-01-15", "description": "Deadline Extended to January 15, 2020!\nCamp/camp: the collision of style and biopolitics\n\u201cThe more we study art, the less we care for nature.\u201d Oscar Wilde\nThe Department of Comparative Literature, Hispanic Studies, and The Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism at Western University invite abstracts for the 22nd annual Graduate Student Conference on \u201cCamp/camp,\u201d which will be taking place March 26-28, 2020.\n\u00a0The ambiguous nature of \u2018camp\u2019 means that it summons different meanings dependent on one\u2019s frame of reference. Camp as sensibility is described by Susan Sontag as using artifice and exaggeration to \u201cconvert the serious into the frivolous\u2014these are grave matters\u201d (1). A grave matter, indeed, when we consider the implications of covering over matters of biopolitics and totalitarianism with the study of aesthetics. Thus, to contrast the study of camp with the study of the camp, as exemplified by the work of Giorgio Agamben, is to reveal the intimate relationship between aesthetics and biopolitics. Following Agamben, we contend that the body is reduced to \u2018bare life\u2019 in the camp, \u201cthe space that is opened up when the state of exception begins to become the rule\u201d (Agamben 168). Today, camp as sensibility and camp as the biopolitical are both ingrained in our current cultural moment as an aesthetics of distraction: we watch the MET Gala, binge RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and Queer Eye, and obsess over Lady Gaga and Barbra Streisand; at the same time children are locked in cages by ICE, we debate the refugee crisis, and conflict continues in places like Hong Kong, Catalonia, and the Middle East, as captured by Marjane Satrapi\u2019s graphic autobiography, Persepolis (2000).\nAlthough a definition of camp as an aesthetic mode often seems elusive, it is something which is found almost everywhere in our contemporary culture. Moreover, the contrast of the camp as a philosophical concept widens the scope of the culture of camp and brings together the intersection of the serious with the frivolous in ways that expose the binary. Camp exposes the dichotomies of art/kitsch and natural/artifice. This can take the form of examining literature, such as the carnivalesque-grotesque in Medieval, Early Modern, and Enlightenment literatures, for example Rabelais\u2019 Gargantua and Pantagruel which makes use of scatological imagery in relation to the body politic. Many genres of literature employ biopolitical elements, especially science fiction, horror, speculative fiction, and trauma literature. In fact, Holocaust literature has itself become its own category, ranging from autobiographical works, such as Primo Levi\u2019s If This is a Man (1947), Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus I & II (1980), and The Diary of Anne Frank (1947), to novels like The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2006).\nIndigenous Canadian art and literature often combine these concepts with the biopolitical, such as in the art and performance of Cree artist Kent Monkman and his alter-ego, Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, whose work juxtaposes trauma with queer aesthetic performances interrupting idyllic vistas of Canada. The contrast between kitsch and camp also emerges in the literary works of Indigenous authors such as Sherman Alexie, Thomas King, Tomson Highway, and Joshua Whitehead, whose novels and poetry impress on the reader the importance of rebelling against the colonial body politic. On the other hand, distinct Canadian landmarks have also been tainted by a camp sensibility, as seen in Henry Hathaway\u2019s Niagara (1953) starring Marilyn Monroe.\nCamp is also sensed through the work of many filmmakers, such as in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s signature style, where camp meets high art and has been popular from the 1960s through to the present. Other Hollywood films and Broadway productions have long embraced camp sensibility in many classic films such as Barbarella (1968), Valley of the Dolls (1967), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and Billy Elliot (2000). Many of these classics also embrace the tyrannical nature of biopolitics that deal with issues in sexuality, disease, abortion, mental illness, and drug use.\nWe look to bridge an abundance of disconnections between culture and politics through conversations on the polysemic nature of camp.

Disgust, exemplified in these classic illustrations, is probably the most visceral of basic human emotions, with a function for an organism\u2019s preservation, and some argue that it engages in particular the so called lower senses: taste, smell and touch. It is also one of the recognized \u201dmoral emotions,\u201d functioning symbolically on social and cultural scales and serving, for example, as an instrument of political discourses. This can be traced in different examples, such as the discrimination of sexual minorities or the populist rhetorics related to the recent refugee crisis.\nIn a more deconstructive vein, disgust has also facilitated the criticism and resistance of prevailing norms and hierarchical constitutions often reiterated in its moral uses. In countercultural movements, such as artistic avantgarde or punk, or in children\u2019s culture, disgust, disgustingness and varied kinds of disgust-objects from slime toys to disgust-evoking sweets serve also as sources of pleasure. In art and popular culture, instead, disgust has proven to be a welcome enhancement to spectacle-seeking entertainment. Disgust, manifested not only in our instinctive recoiling from danger and decay, but also in these varied kinds of symbolic discourses and cultural products aiming to provoke, agitate or bring about enjoyment, is thus more than the biological mechanism seeking to protect animals from particular kinds of dangers, or a negative emotion negatively felt.\nWe now invite researchers from a variety of fields ranging from sociology, cultural studies and philosophy to biology and other natural sciences to reflect on the different varieties and functions of disgust in a three-day seminar at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 18-20 March 2020.\nThemes addressed may vary, including yet not restricted to:- conceptualizations of disgust- disgust\u2019s relationship to other emotions and affects- disgust\u2019s moral, social and/or biological aspects and uses- disgust, decay and biological, cognitive, socio-cultural or symbolic dangers- disgust and it\u2019s uses as low or high culture- disgust and disgust-objects as humour or art- disgust and disgust-objects as pleasure and entertainment, for instance in popular cultural phenomena, transgressive art, extreme cuisine or children\u2019s culture- disgust\u2019s and disgust-objects\u2019s relationship to cultural change, for instance in political discourses, hate speech and their rhetoricscountercultural disgust and its potential for change- disgust, ethnic minorities and refugee crisis- disgust, gender, sexuality and LGBTQI- disgust and death- disgust and climate change- disgust, foodways, food identities and food economies- disgust, social class and social hierarchies- disgust and identity\nThe proposals for a presentation (no more than 300-500 words) and additional information (such as contact details, affiliation and a short biography), should be sent by using our abstract system by December 11th, 2019.

It has been a popular theme in literature since, notably in the First World War novels by Rebecca West and Pat Barker, and in a slew of fictional works involving veteran crusaders, ex-servicemen turned investigators, and the psychologically damaged. Artists also chose images of homecoming to create idealised depictions of family homecoming, or portray the hardships of a long absence and journey home. Physical and mental injury, and their impact on those returning to civilian life, have been particularly useful as drivers of fictional narratives, as seen in more recent television series like BBC\u2019s Bodyguard and 20th Century Fox\u2019s Homeland.\nPortrayals of veterans and homecoming soldiers makes them familiar figures for popular consumption, but it also raises questions about how and why we view them the way we do. Which aspects of the homecoming experience do creators choose to focus on in their writing, art, or media works? Is there an emphasis on portraying homecoming soldiers as damaged by their experiences? If so, in what way? What positive stories of the impact of military service are there? And how do these relate to the view of warfare in the time in which they were made? How are veterans of victorious wars portrayed, compared to those who lost?\nSubmission Process\nWe invite proposals for 20-minute papers from postgraduate, ECRs and established scholars from the fields of history, literature, the arts, media, music, or any other discipline.

January 24, 2020\nEPTC/TCEP Panel: Indigenous Phenomenology: Body Sovereignty, Land Sovereignty\n\u00a0\nThe 2020 meeting of the Society for Existential and Phenomenological Theory and Culture (EPTC) will be held at Western University in London, Ontario from June 1-3, 2020, in conjunction with the annual Congress of the Canadian Federation for the Social Sciences and Humanities. This panel will interrogate what it means to formulate a phenomenology of Indigeneity in a world made white through colonialism. Following Sarah Ahmed\u2019s \u201cA Phenomenology of Whiteness,\u201d this panel looks to theorize a resurgence of Indigenous peoples in the face of the white, settler colonial state, and to understand this through a \u2018phenomenology of Indigeneity\u2019. As Ahmed says, \u201cIf whiteness is inherited, then it is also reproduced,\u201d and the settler-colonial state plays a major part in reproducing and passing on this normalized whiteness, while othering Indigenous bodies through invisibility and hypervisibility. Thus, the focus on the lived experience and orientation of Indigenous peoples is necessary to understand the ways in which Indigenous resurgence is possible, and how it is inherently tied to bodily sovereignty and land sovereignty.\nPapers accepted for this panel will engage with the tradition of critical phenomenology, while considering ways in which we can understand Indigenous philosophies and critical thought through this lens.\n\u00a0\nTopics might include, but are not limited to, discussion of the phenomenology of Indigeneity in:\n-testimonials: autobiography, testimonials at official inquiries, autobiographical poetry, etc.\n-Indigenous resurgence through languages, culture, governance, etc.\n-critique of the emergence/creation of Eastern M\u00e9tis (and other instances of settler practices of self-Indigenizing)\n-bodily autonomy, including: body positivity movement, tattooing, fat movement, expressions of sexuality, gender, and two-spirit\n-land-based practices, pedagogy, food independence, cities, land protection\n-environmental protection, protest, environmental racism\n-legislative issues, contemporary treaty making\n-the experience of Indigenous women within the settler colonial state (MMIWG, human trafficking)\n-urbanization, urban reserves, on-reserve innovation\nInterested authors should submit the following electronically via email to Indigenous.phenomenology@gmail.com in .doc, .dox, or .rtf format:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of your paper, maximum 4000 words, prepared for anonymous review.

As a result, initiatives that claim to take seriously the religious and cultural dimensions of peacebuilding have increased exponentially.\nThe evident optimism and increased support for this area of peacebuilding practice prompts some important questions. Is the current optimism about these approaches justified by project results and outcomes? To what extent is project design based on existing and verifiable evidence? How do the practical ideas and application link to current theoretical ideas in the subject areas of religion, reconciliation and peacebuilding?\nGiven the increased emphasis in academia on best practice and \u2018research impact\u2019, one of the ways we might consider these questions is by taking the outcomes of practical peacebuilding initiatives as a starting point from which to retrospectively analyse the complex factors, ideas, processes and dynamics which led to that point. An emphasis on impact can enable contributors to critically consider:\nProposals need not only focus on violent conflicts, but projects addressing structural violence, oppression and inequalities are equally welcome. Organisers will look favourably on projects which address contemporary challenges such as violence stemming from the Climate Crisis; resource scarcity; the global rise in populism and nationalism; contemporary conflicts such as Syrian and Iraq.\nThe conference organisers are also keen to proactively support and develop discussions between academics, practitioners and policy makers, and therefore particularly welcome joint presentations from contributors which span these three sectors.\nThe conference organisers recognise that the concepts of religion and culture are complex, dynamic and contested, and encourage contributors to recognise and engage with existing debates in these subject areas.\nProcess for submitting abstracts/expressions of interest for collaboration\nParticipants are invited to submit abstracts of 250-300 words (in Word or Open Office format). Proposals should also include name, institutional affiliation (if relevant), a short biography (no more than 100 words) and an email address and phone number. Proposals for panel discussions (organised by the participants) will be considered. We hope to publish a selection of papers. Presentations will be in English, and each speaker will be allocated 20 minutes with up to 10 minutes for discussion. During the conference there will also be sessions allocated specifically for open discussions and networking.\nDeadline for receipt of abstracts is 1 st Feb, 2020.\nConfirmation of paper acceptance will be at the latest 28th February, 2020.\nThe University of Winchester Centre of Religion, Reconciliation and Peace The conference is being organised and hosted by the \u2018Centre of Religion, Reconciliation and Peace\u2019 (CRRP) at the University of Winchester.

Nevertheless, it is a constant and growing threat: dispossession due to the climate crisis and environmental racism; the mass dispossession of bodies from their homelands due to civil unrest or state brutality; the consistent refusal of colonial nations to concede land to their original custodians; and neoliberal moves that render every cultural worker, artist and student economically precarious and bound to debt. These forms of dispossession are made profitable under disaster capitalism. Yet to speak of dispossession still foregrounds possession in an exchange system based on privatized ownership.\nNew systems of evaluation, new circulations of making, thinking, doing, and new modes of exchange are necessitated, in which dispossession might be a nucleus for positive, resistant, and insurrectionary models. While art is easily co-opted by the dominant economy, cultural workers of all stripes are at the forefront of this work today.\nWe ask:\nThis conference invites papers that deal with questions around forced or chosen dispossession, alternative economies and creative responses to global economic paradigms.

Prisons are variously known as jails, gaols, penitentiaries, detention centres, correctional centres, and remand centres. They can be used as a tool of political repression, or a means of detaining large groups of civilians during times of war.\nIncarceration has a long history, and despite its core commonality, as an experience it has varied historically, and continues to vary, in different societies all over the world. Although imprisonment is most commonly in a building, often purpose-built, it has variously taken place on ships, in camps, on islands, and in castles, fortresses, penal colonies, quarries, sewers, cages and dungeons. Imprisonment has become the dominant form of punishment in most societies across the world, and may occur prior to trial or as a result of sentencing by a properly constituted court. Imprisonment without trial or due process occurs in various forms in most societies across the world, mostly sanctioned by the state itself, sometimes used as a political strategy by military, ideological, political or religious groups within a state, or by groups desirous of becoming a state.\nThe prison has become a formidable employer, sometimes the dominant employer in neighbourhoods or towns. Over time, it has also been the site of creativity: prison labour, prison art and prison literature (including poetry, drama and autobiography) have contributed hugely to our understanding both of the phenomenon of imprisonment and of the impact it has on lives. It can therefore be approached from a variety of experiential perspectives \u2013 that of prisoner, visitor, employee, volunteer, writer, artist, analyst or researcher.\nThe prison is a powerful metaphor as well, with the capacity to describe a challenging or difficult situation for an individual, a family or a community that seemingly presents no way out, and which presses down upon the human psyche in often unbearable ways. It has been an effective trope within literature, art, poetry and drama.\nKey TopicsWe welcome contributions about the prison from a wide range of perspectives, including legal, architectural, criminological, historical, geographical, fictional, psychotherapeutic, artistic, phenomenological, biographical and autobiographical points of view.\nContributions are particularly welcomed from former prisoners, detainees, incarcerated asylum seekers, former prisoners of war, political prisoners or those detained because of nationalist, religious or other convictions, those who have been to prison and have written about the experience; those who have fictionalised the prison experience in art and literature; those who have done paid or voluntary work in prison; and those who have researched the prison of the past and of the present. Additionally, we hope to hear from those involved with the architecture and design of prisons, those who are directly or indirectly involved with the delivery of incarceration,and those involved with any prisoners\u2019 rights groups or with those who seek to ameliorate incarceration by providing therapeutic drama, literacy, education, counselling, religious support, death row support, and other services.\nAll genres and media will be considered, in order to examine the widest possible range of representations, past and contemporary, which inform us about the strange phenomenon of the prison with a view to forming a selective innovative interdisciplinary publication to engender further research and collaboration. We particularly welcome creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations, and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate.\nTopics for discussion include, but are not restricted to:\nPrisoners and the Prison Experience~ Types of Prisoners: political dissidents, prisoners of war, violent offenders, non-violent offenders, white collar criminals, innocent/wrongly accused, asylum seekers~ The female experience in prison~ Transgendered people in prison~ Relationships in prison: motherhood, sex, friendship and bonding, relationships with people \u2018outside\u2019~ Rape, assault and other acts of violence~ Torture in prison~ Death and dying in prison~ Social structures within the prison environment~ Prisoner interactions with guards and administrators~ Historical perspectives on the prison experience~ Race, racism and prison~ Poverty, class and prison~ Writing, art and other creative practices in prison~ Representing the prison experience in literature, theatre, TV, film, video games, music and art~ mental health in prison~ addictions, self-harm and suicide~ medical ethics and care in prison\nLife After Prison~ Challenges of reintegration~ Rehabilitation and education~ Discrimination against former inmates~ Family and friends coping with the release of loved ones~ Community service and volunteerism\nPrison As Institution~Prison as workplace: experiences of guards, administrators and institutional officials~ Prison spaces: architectural design in theory and practice, boot camps, work camps, open air prisons, etc.~ Technologies of incarceration~ Teaching and learning in prison~ Spirituality and religion in prison~ Counselling and other clinical experiences with prisoners~ (In)Famous prisons and their legacy (Auschwitz, Guantanamo Bay, Alcatraz, Newgate Gaol, etc.)~ Prisons and dark tourism~ Prison conditions around the globe~ Economics of incarceration: politics of awarding contracts, private vs public management, impact of prison location on local communities, etc.\nPrisons in Law and Policy~ Theories and practices in rehabilitation and humane containment~ Balancing punishment and human rights~ Prison reform initiatives~ Innovative approaches to incarceration~ Relationship between justice system and corrections system~ Race, class, sex and other forms of discrimination in sentencing~ Correctional services as public policy: governmental/civil service perspectives~ National and international legal provisions around prison conditions and prisoners\u2019 rights~ NGOs and charities working in the area of prison reform~ Social attitudes toward prison and prisoners\nWhat To SendThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

Behind the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain, state control over every aspect of daily life gave rise to corruption, oppression, deprivation, ethnic conflict, censorship, and general atmosphere of isolation from western democracies and a deep paranoia about western hegemony. Nearly three decades after waves of citizen-led democratic revolutions washed over the former Communist bloc, leaving newly independent nations in their wake, the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0and its legacy continues to leave an indelible mark on contemporary geopolitical relations as well as the socio-cultural development of communities affected both directly and indirectly by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Even popular culture reflects an ongoing preoccupation with the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0era, as evidenced by the popularity of television series such as Chernobyl and The Americans.\nOf course, it is possible to identify contemporary echoes of the power dynamics that underpinned the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain. Evidence has confirmed reports of Russian meddling in United States elections in 2016 and 2018 as well as in the 2016 referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union. Human rights abuses in Russia and the 2014 annexation of the Crimea by the Russian Federation have triggered international outrage, with the latter action being punished by Russia\u2019s expulsion from the G7. Recent elections around the world have granted power to far-right political parties and political leaders with authoritarian ambitions that are have been compared to the dictatorial regimes that ruled the former Communist bloc countries. In an era where quality journalism is delegitimised, pro-Government propaganda is promoted as \u2018truth\u2019, democratic processes are undermined, education and research are marginalised, the arts and other platforms for dissent are neutralised, and laws are enacted to disenfranchise and discriminate against certain groups, we are once again bearing witness to the evils associated with the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain.\nAt the same time, it is important to acknowledge any benefits that arose from the Communist regimes who took power at a time when post-war Europe was healing and rebuilding itself. Actions that may seem evil when considered in terms of the values and assumptions of Western democracies may be understood differently when viewed from other perspectives. It is therefore important to abandon the Manichean views of good and evil that prevailed during the heyday of the Communist bloc, and instead strive for more nuanced evaluations of the evils of the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0and its legacy.\n\u00a0\nKey Topics\nAccordingly, this project aims to provide a platform for interdisciplinary engagement arising from presentations, papers, panels, workshops, readings, performances, screenings and installations on any aspect of the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0and its legacy. Potential topics for exploration include, but are not limited to:\n~ ghost towns (e.g. Chernobyl) and former military basis~ religion in totalitarian states~ technology, industry and innovation behind the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain~ purges, persecution and punishment~ evil in medicine (e.g. banning of abortions in Romania)~ dissent, rebellion, uprising~ diaries, letters, oral histories and personal accounts (Samizdat)~ education and the role of schools in supporting \u2018evil\u2019~ contemporary tourist attractions and their meaning (e.g. remnants of Berlin Wall, Lenin\u2019s Mausoleum)~ lessons to be learned from the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0era~ parallels between the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0era and the contemporary political climate~ depictions of the\u00a0iron\u00a0curtain\u00a0era in film, photography, literature, music and visual arts\nWhat To Send\nThe aim of this inclusive interdisciplinary conference and collaborative networking event is to bring people together and encourage creative conversations in the context of a variety of formats: papers, seminars, workshops, storytelling, performances, poster presentations, problem-solving sessions, case studies, panels, q&a\u2019s, round-tables etc. Creative responses to the subject, such as poetry/prose, short film screenings/original drama, installations and alternative presentation styles that engage the audience and foster debate are particularly encouraged.

Whether we continue to let them act on usor we react against them, their afterlives extend into the future, echoing across ourtheoretical markers for their endings. Strict periodization is fraught and the ways in which weread and reread histories often result in puzzling networks of relations between historicallegacies and our own position as readers. The afterlives of histories and cultures are always,then, practices of reading apr\u00e8s-coup.Afterlives is an alternative to thinking in explicitly marked eras. Instead of rushing to add\u201cpost-\u201d to theory, modernity, national identity, slavery, the Cold War, capitalism, andcolonialism, we might see these in their afterlives as spectres continuing to haunt ourdiscourse. Some of these are treated as if clinically dead, others not quite past/post-, butnone of them fail to influence our imaginings of the future. How have these informedalternative futures, such as queer utopia or afrofuturism? How do we renegotiate orreactivate the afterlives of ideas in the material world? What, for instance, do we do withfascist architecture or confederate monuments? How do we reactivate long-forgotten films,books, photographs, notes, marginalia, so alive in their contemporary moment? And to whatend? What happens to afterlives in an era of climate change and extinction, when the verypromise of future resonance is irrevocably threatened if not doomed?We are interested in how philosophers, theologians, writers, architects, artists, filmmakers,scientists and activists theorize in the wake of major social, political, historical, and climateevents.

We are seeking papers from practitioners in the field of art restitution that will serve as a basis for discussion of these terms.\nThe criteria for determining whether objects lost between 1933 and 1945 in a manner that justifies restitution were articulated by the Allied powers in 1943 and then codified in postwar restitution laws. In the modern era of Holocaust-era asset restitution, those standards were replaced by abstract phrases such as\u00a0Nazi confiscated art, forced sale\u00a0and\u00a0sale under duress\u00a0without any qualifications attached. But what is meant by these terms?\nSuggested topics\nHistorical analysis of the mechanics of dispossession.Please discuss one or more types of transactions resulting in the loss of artworks such as: the granting of exports licenses; house sales; the actions of shipping companies; use the national heritage designations; bank loans; and \u201crequired\u201d donations, etc.Is a\u00a0forced sale\u00a0the same as a\u00a0sale under duress? If so, why? If not, why not? How do they differ?What constitutes a\u00a0transaction induced by threats or duress or involving unlawful dispossession? Is such a transaction what we presently term a\u00a0forced sale\u00a0or\u00a0sale under duress?Are looting and theft the same as\u00a0confiscation, or is\u00a0confiscation\u00a0merely one form of theft?Can an institution be the source of\u00a0coercion\u00a0or only an individual?What constitutes\u00a0relinquishment? Is\u00a0relinquishment\u00a0the same as a\u00a0forced sale, sale under duress, or is it more akin to\u00a0Aryanization? How do export permits and/or licenses relate to\u00a0relinquishment?Does seizure by measures taken by the NSDAP, its formations or affiliated organizations include the granting or denial of export permits and/or licenses?Does the date of the loss impact the term used to describe the loss?Does the classification of the loss affect the resolution of a restitution claim?Kindly note the symposium will not address the issue of\u00a0flight goods (Fluchtgut).\n\u00a0\nFormat\nProposals should address terms and concepts as suggested above in 500 words or less.\nPlease be sure to include your full name, affiliation (if applicable), email address, and a brief bio or CV.\nSubmitted proposals will be reviewed by a committee of practitioners in the field.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPapers can be submitted at:\u00a0https://www.dfs.ny.gov/form/call-for-papers-submission-form\n\u00a0\nImportant dates\nThe deadline for submitting a proposal is Friday, November 15, 2019.\nSubmitters will be informed by Monday, December 2, 2019 whether their proposal was accepted.

SECTOR COUPLING: How to regulate convergence?", "location": "Florence", "organization": "Organization: Florence School of Regulation", "conference_date": "Event Date: 2020-06-25\r\n                        to 2020-06-26", "submission_date": "Abstract Due: 2020-02-03", "description": "Most infrastructures have developed independently from one another and constitute self-contained socio-technical systems. This is, for example, the case of electricity, of gas, of telecommunications, of air transport, but also of railways. Consequently, also regulation was set up in a self-contained sector-specific manner.\nHowever, this way of doing things cannot continue into the future, as the different infrastructure sectors are converging. This is, first, because of the technological and economic dynamics that has been triggered by liberalisation, and which has led to new technologies, often at the interface of the different sectors (e.g., power-to-gas), along with corresponding cross-sectoral business strategies.\nConvergence also results from recent developments of digital networks (and in particular of the fifth generation of wireless technologies, the 5G) which increasingly act as driver of convergence between sectors, leading to cross-sectoral and much more integrated infrastructures services (e.g., \u201cMobility-as-a-Service\u201d or MaaS). The take-off of the Internet of Things (IoT) based on 5G networks, which is addressed as the next Industrial Revolution, is expected to accelerate this trend. Finally, climate and other ecological challenges force a direct comparison among different sectors, such as in the case of externalities caused by energy generation (by renewables or by fossil fuels) or by the different transport models.\nFor all three reasons, a more convergent view of the different network industries is rapidly emerging \u2026 but will it translate into converging regulation or even into the regulation of convergence? Such is the topic of the 9th Florence Conference on the Regulation of Infrastructures.\nMore precisely, we look for contributions that\u00a0link different infrastructure sectors, especially in terms of regulating interfaces between the different sectors, as well as regulating more integrated and converging sectors.\u00a0Contributions\u00a0utilising multidisciplinary as well as interdisciplinary approaches\u00a0to regulation are welcome.

The reason for this development was due to the involvement of Chinese in the trade sector. Chinese involved in buying donkey skin in Nigeria and other African countries which they use to produce medicine (Ejiao which is a medicine produced from donkey hides known to cure many ailments). This further led to the hiking of donkey price and the enrollment of many people in the trade.

While individual studies, particularly on ekphrasis, have examined some of the uses of physical objects in ancient novels (Bartsch 1989; Holzmeister 2014) or the depiction of scenes from ancient novels on objects (e.g. Bruneau 1965), there have been few systematic examinations of the presence, function, and interpretations of material objects in and about ancient prose fiction more broadly. Notable exceptions include Magdeleine Clo\u2019s 2014 thesis, Les objets dans le roman grec, and the 2016 Rethymnon International Conference on the Ancient Novel on \u201cMaterial Culture and the Ancient Novel\u201d (Oct. 14-15), both of which have demonstrated the potential of examining objects within ancient novels as tools of characterization, plot devices, and symbols, but the topic has thus far received little attention in the United States.\nWe therefore invite submissions on the ancient novel and material culture. Papers may examine any of the ancient novels or other works of ancient prose fiction, including Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Byzantine.
