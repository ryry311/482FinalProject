To get\na feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see some delegates photos\navailable at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp \nwww.pixagogo.com/1676934789 \nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for a\ndiverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such\nas: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies, and\nresearch centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also attempts\nto connect participants from institutions that have teaching as their main\nmission with those who are affiliated with institutions that have research\nas their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to achieve its\ninstitution and geography diversity objectives.\" 138939\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n", "name": "World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing", "location": "Las Vegas, USA", "submission_date": "April 20, 2013", "notification_date": "May 11, 2013", "conference_date": "July 22-25, 2013"}]
