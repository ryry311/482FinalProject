All reasonable\ntypesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted\npapers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to\nprepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been\npreviously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The\nfirst page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a\nmaximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content\nof the paper. The name of the conference (ie, ICWN) must also be\nstated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word\nabstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)\nwill be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees.\nPapers whose authors include a member of the conference program\ncommittee will be evaluated using the double-blinded review process.\n(Essay/philosophical papers will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper.

Though, there is no guarantee that the\nproceedings will also be included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings;\nin the past, the proceedings were included in these databases. Therefore,\nwe will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI\nCompendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for\ndistribution on site at the conference.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the\nopportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication\nin these books.

Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission \"name of\n      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the\n      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE\n      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to\n      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable\n(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a\nparticular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication; these formatting instructions appear at:\nhttp://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style\nformat). Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper.

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n"}, {"description": "\n\n\nPlease Accept our Apology for Multiple Posting.

LATE BREAKING PAPERS: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the\n      following on the first page of your submission \"name of conference:\n      LATE BREAKING PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-\n      Ready paper will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and\n      the author will be given the opportunity to present the paper in a\n      formal session.\n\n   2. POSITION PAPERS: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 5. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"name of conference: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be\n      limited to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be\n      given the opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   3. ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPERS: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission \"name of\n      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the\n      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE\n      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to\n      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable\n(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a\nparticular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication; these formatting instructions appear at:\nhttp://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style\nformat). Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. All proceedings are also approved for inclusion into\nEBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The\ntitles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes\nbibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books. We\nanticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these\nbook series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com ; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org ; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com ; and others). For a recent\nand a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that\nhave been published based on the extended versions of many of our\ncongress papers, see the link below:\n\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals \n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement,\nwill have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the\nFinal Edition of the conference proceedings which will go to press\nsoon after the conference (the conference would then make the necessary\narrangements to ship the printed proceedings/books to such authors).\nThe Final Edition of the conference proceedings will be identical to\nearlier edition except for a number of sections/chapters appended to\nthe proceedings/book.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nThe federated Congress that this conference is part of is composed of\nresearch presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations,\ntutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations.

The Congress is among the top five\nlargest annual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer\nengineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have attendees from\nabout 85 countries/territories.\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\ni.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines.\n\n\nTUTORIALS:\n\nAll tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials\nthat have been approved so far can be found at: (Under Construction)\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/tutorials .\nWe plan to offer about 12 tutorials and panel discussions.

The intention was to reach out to the\ngroup of game scholars working at St Petersburg State University who have\nmade a notable contribution to the community, particularly at the PoCG 2018\nconference, and to accept their bid as hosts. I was not involved in this\ndecision but I have confidence that the committee thought about the issues\ncurrently being discussed. I believe that where the conference series has\npreviously been held was taken into account; St Petersburg will mark the\nfarthest afield from Western Europe that the series has gone, with perhaps\nthe exception of Istanbul in 2014. That is to say, there was the intention\nto be less Western-centric and to be inclusive of scholars who might\notherwise not have been able to participate, building bridges between\nacademic communities. As has already been mentioned, some of those who\nmight be excluded by the decision to only hold academic conferences in\ndemocratic countries include LGBT+ scholars from non-democratic countries.\n\nThere obviously has to be a balancing exercise as to who is included and\nwho else are then excluded by this very act of inclusion. Further, who is\nmaking the decision and how they are doing so must also be scrutinised. I\nbelieve that we are interrogating this now on Gamesnetwork. As a result, it\nis appropriate for the steering committee to review the situation and to\nconsider what can be done to foster inclusivity. They will report back\nsoon. I will also consult again with the organising committee.\n\nThis conference will not be deemed by the Russian government to be\nLGBT-themed. We very much welcome any LGBT+ content that is germane to the\nconference theme of =E2=80=98the aesthetics of computer games=E2=80=99 and =\nI do not believe\nthat the inclusion of such content will lead to attention from government\nforces, particularly because there will not be anyone present under the age\nof 18 and also because it is a small-scale English-speaking conference. We\nare now, however, considering having all the workshops and panels be on the\ntheme of =E2=80=98diversity in games=E2=80=99, with the papers still being =\non =E2=80=98the\naesthetics of computer games=E2=80=99. More details on this will follow.\n\nIt goes without saying that no city is safe. London, where I live, is\ndeemed a 'safe' city, but has recently seen homophobic hate crimes rise.\nhttps://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/hate-crime-dashboard/\n\nA particularly nasty attack on a bus against two women was just reported\nlast week. Of course London does not lie in an authoritarian state.\nTraveling to another city in another country involves a calculated risk for\nthose of us who are LGBT+. It is a highly personal decision to be made\nafter some thought and on the basis of the available information. Here, it\nmay be appropriate to distinguish between safety in Russia taken as a whole\n(listed as a lowly 157 in the 2018 Spartacus Guide), and safety in St\nPetersburg, perhaps its most LGBT-friendly city. On the one hand, it may\nhave been paternalistic for us to point to particular scattered sources\nthat one should consult when making this personal decision, but on the\nother, we could perhaps have done more to provide guidance. How to provide\nthis guidance - over and above having encouraged individuals to contact us\n- will be considered by the steering committee.\n\nThe technical feasibility of teleconferencing has not been settled and is\nstill on the discussion agenda. Obviously, it is no substitute to actually\nattending a conference and as such remains exclusionary, but it could be a\nuseful tool in a difficult situation that does not admit of easy solutions.\n\nFinally, to address a particular point that have been raised:\n\nI'm afraid I do not know about the specifics of laws aimed at known\nactivists. I will find out and let you know, Phoenix. This information will\nthen be on the website.\n\nIf my previous email was rushed and did not attend to the complexities of\nthe matter, I apologise. It has still not been possible to contact all the\nmembers of the steering committee and I represent here, as program chair,\nonly my own thoughts. Again, anyone who wants to get in touch with us\noutside of the listserv is most welcome to do so.\n\nThe steering committee will report back soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nFeng\n\n\n\nTeaching Fellow in Digital Media and Culture\nDepartment of Digital Humanities\nKing's College London\nRoom C0.07, Chesham Building\nLondon, WC2R 2LS\n\n\nOn Sat, Jun 8, 2019 at 1:02 AM =D0=9C=D0=B0=D0=BA=D1=81=D0=B8=D0=BC =D0=9F=\n=D0=BE=D0=B4=D0=B2=D0=B0=D0=BB=D1=8C=D0=BD=D1=8B=D0=B9 =\n wrote:\n\n> Dear all,\n>\n> First, I must agree with most points made throughout this thread.

For our authorities, it is just another academic event in a lon=\ng\n> chain of academic events which happen in our country all the time. There =\nis\n> no reason for them to pay any attention to this particular conference. We\n> must take into account that Russia hosts many academic conferences in\n> almost all academic fields each year (and we already hosted 2 internation=\nal\n> game studies conferences in particular). Now we must ask whether any\n> non-LGBT-themed academic conference was ever attacked in Russia on the\n> basis of having LGBT people or LGBT-themed presentations in them. Neither\n> my colleagues, nor I can remember any such case, quick search also yields\n> no results. To conclude: although nobody in a right mind will tell you th=\nat\n> an LGBT person has nothing to be afraid of in Russia, there is also no\n> reason to think that any reactionary forces will decide to target this\n> particular academic conference on any basis, especially given that this\n> conference is in English.\n>\n> Next, I=E2=80=99d like to address a broader matter regarding organizing\n> conferences in anti-democratic countries in general. I believe there are\n> LGBT+ scholars in all academic fields and I know that many academic field=\ns\n> within social sciences and humanities have LGBT-related topics. If the\n> democratic countries decide to withdraw all international conferences fro=\nm\n> anti-democratic countries for security reasons (until everyone becomes\n> democratic), then I=E2=80=99m afraid this enterprise is doomed.

It is\n> clearly not the case. We started from whether or not it is safe for LGBT+\n> people to attend this very particular game studies conference, but after\n> several posts I can see carpet-bombing statements regarding whether or no=\nt\n> we should organize academic events AS SUCH in countries like Russia =E2=\n=80=93 or at\n> least it sounds that way because it is not specified anymore whether it i=\ns\n> about LGBT-themed conference or a conference in general, whether it is a\n> game studies conference or a conference in general.

Some class=\nes are organized into formal game design programs while others are not. T=\nhey can be offered in a wide range of departments and disciplines, includ=\ning media studies, communications, computer science, sociology, English, =\neducation, political science, art, and many others. The primary goal of s=\nuch courses is varied: to teach game design skills, game writing, product=\nion, development, critical analysis skills, as well as the history and co=\nntext of digital games. This workshop is for instructors in higher educat=\nion of all such courses to discuss their approaches, troubleshoot issues,=\n as well as identify best practices for the course and assignment design.=\n\nThe workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 DiGRA 2019 confere=\nnce in Kyoto, Japan, and will take place on August 6th, 2019. It builds o=\nn successful past versions of the workshop run at both DiGRA and =46DG in=\n 2014 and 2015, as well as on a later workshop on transgressive teaching =\nstrategies in game studies at NDigra in 2018 and HEVGA Game Educators=E2=80=\n=99 Summits and symposia held in 2017 and 2018. The aim of this iteration=\n is threefold: to broaden the scope of teaching about games more generall=\ny, to build a community around pedagogy and to generate scholarship that =\nwill result in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nObjectives and Outcomes\nThe aim of the workshop is to benefit pedagogy about games by discussing =\ncurrent issues and potential future directions in games teaching as well =\nas to provide a forum for sharing and critiquing pedagogical practices. T=\nhe latter will be especially valuable for scholars who are among the only=\n faculty at their institution teaching games.\nThe workshop will be conducted in two parts: The morning session will be =\ndedicated to paper presentations and discussions. The post-lunch session =\nwill be organized as work sessions, where groups discuss particular topic=\ns (self-organized by interests).\n\n*** Topics ***\nThe workshop invites papers about teaching games in higher education. The=\n following list suggests topics, but other topics relevant to pedagogical=\n approaches in teaching games are welcome.\n=E2=97=8F Pedagogical methods to teaching games\n=E2=97=8F Integrating games into a pre-existing curriculum\n=E2=97=8F Case studies=E2=80=94teaching specific topics or areas\n=E2=97=8F Bridging theory and practice through the curriculum\n=E2=97=8F Creating new teaching resources and tools\n=E2=97=8F Teaching students to study players\n=E2=97=8F Teaching game research methods\n=E2=97=8F Industry partnerships\n=E2=97=8F Working with diverse groups of students and multi-disciplinary =\nfaculty\n=E2=97=8F Logistical challenges of teaching games (access to games, prese=\nrvation, and fair use)\n\n*** Submission guidelines ***\nWe will accept submissions for short papers between 1000 and 3000 words i=\nn length (excluding references). Submissions will be subject to double-bl=\nind peer review. Each submission will receive feedback from at least two =\nreviewers. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to give an ora=\nl presentation of their submission. Submissions must use the provided MS =\nWord template or the LaTeX template for the workshop (both templates are =\navailable at hevga.org/digracfp - in case the page is down, see links bel=\now).\n\nAll submissions should be in the PD=46 format and be submitted through Ea=\nsyChair. Accepted papers will be made available online at the workshop we=\nbpage.\n\nA special issue of the ToDiGRA Journal (published by ETC Press at Carnegi=\ne Mellon) is a planned outcome of the workshop. Selected workshop papers =\nwill be invited to submit a journal article version for inclusion in a sp=\necial issue of the ToDiGRA Journal. Publication in the special issue will=\n require passing a second round of peer reviews.\n\n*** Workshop Deadlines ***\nDeadline for paper submissions: May 31, 2019\nNotification of acceptance: June 28, 2019\n=46inal drafts of papers due: July 19, 2019\nWorkshop: August 6, 2019\nRevised papers submitted to journal for publication: October 1, 2019\n\n*** Webpages ***\nWorkshop webpage: hevga.org/digracfp\nSubmissions page: easychair.org/conferences/=3Fconf=3Dtgpa19\nTemplate .docx: interactivenarrativedesign.org/digrawstemplate.docx\nTemplate LaTeX: www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tgap-workshop-digra-temp=\nlate-2019/prjhkzzstyym\n\n\n*** Workshop Location and Time ***\nLocation: Room Zonshin 206, Ritsumeikan University Kinugasa Campus, Kyoto=\n, Japan\nDate and Time: August 6, 2019, 9:00-15:50 with a lunch break 12:00-13:00\n\nWelcome=21\n\nOn behalf of the organizers,\nMia Consalvo, Mirjam P Eladhari, Jonathan Elmergreen, Clara =46ern=C3=A1n=\ndez-Vara, William Huber, Hartmut Koenitz, Petri Lankoski, Adam Mayes, And=\ny Phelps\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nMirjam Palosaari Eladhari,\n\nResearch: sites.google.com/site/mirjame/publications\nArt: www.saatchiart.com/mirjame\n\nTime zone: Central European time (CET), =3D UTC/GMT +1 hour, =3D PST - 9,=\n =3D EST - 6 CST -7\n\n\n--\nGamesnetwork, discussion list of Digital Games Research Association, www.digra.org\nNote: to unsubscribe, send \"UNSUBSCRIBE GAMESNETWORK\" to LISTSERV@UTA.FI from\nyour subscribed email account.

The Final Edition of the proceedings will be\n                  identical to the Preliminary Edition except for the addition\n                  of the accepted LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS,\n                  ABSTRACTS/POSTERS at the end of the books. The conference\n                  would make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed\n                  proceedings/books to such authors.\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:\n\nIn response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to\nsubmit their papers for evaluation in one of the following three paper\ncategories:\n\n   1. LATE BREAKING PAPERS: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the\n      following on the first page of your submission \"name of conference:\n      LATE BREAKING PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-\n      Ready paper will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and\n      the author will be given the opportunity to present the paper in a\n      formal session.\n\n   2. POSITION PAPERS: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 5. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"name of conference: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be\n      limited to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be\n      given the opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   3. ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPERS: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission \"name of\n      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the\n      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE\n      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to\n      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable\n(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a\nparticular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication; these formatting instructions appear at:\nhttp://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style\nformat). Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. All proceedings are also approved for inclusion into\nEBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The\ntitles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes\nbibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books. We\nanticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these\nbook series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com ; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org ; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com ; and others). For a recent\nand a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that\nhave been published based on the extended versions of many of our\ncongress papers, see the link below:\n\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals \n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement,\nwill have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the\nFinal Edition of the conference proceedings which will go to press\nsoon after the conference (the conference would then make the necessary\narrangements to ship the printed proceedings/books to such authors).\nThe Final Edition of the conference proceedings will be identical to\nearlier edition except for a number of sections/chapters appended to\nthe proceedings/book.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nThe federated Congress that this conference is part of is composed of\nresearch presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations,\ntutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations.

They must report new research results that represent\n   a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for\n   the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work\n   presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of\n   maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal\n   papers.\n\n - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):\n   Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide\n   overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented\n   in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with\n   some additional work can be published as regular papers.\n\n - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):\n   Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in\n   their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to\n   provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.\n\nREVIEW PROCESS\n\n   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that\n   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel\n   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.\n   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,\n   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference\n   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members\n   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\n   review process.

Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper.

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n"}, {"description": "\n\n\t Fri, 16 Jan 2015 16:49:02 -0800 (PST)\n\n\t Fri, 16 Jan 2015 16:49:02 -0800 (PST)\n\n\t Fri, 16 Jan 2015 16:49:02 -0800 (PST)\n\n\n\n\n\t    d=\"scan'208\"; a=3018720\n\n\n\t 16 Jan 2015 16:49:00 -0800\n\n\t Fri, 16 Jan 2015 19:49:00 -0500 (EST)\n\n\n July 27-30, 2015, USA): submission deadline: March 31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         CALL  FOR  PAPERS\n                                and\n                    CALL FOR WORKSHOPS/SESSIONS\n\n                              HIMS'15\n            International Conference on Health Informatics\n                        and Medical Systems\n         July 27-30, 2015, Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, USA\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/conferences/hims15\n\nPaper Submission Deadline: March 31, 2015\n\nYou are invited to submit a paper for consideration.

Furthermore, the costs of powering these HPC systems\nruns into millions of dollars per year, and are increasing as these systems\ntarget sustained petascale and plan for exascale. Adding to the concerns\ndue to power and cooling requirements and associated costs, empirical data\nshow that every 10 degree Celsius increase in temperature results in a\ndoubling of the system failure rate, which reduces the reliability of these\nexpensive systems. At the same time, the increasing proliferation of\nvirtualization technologies and the consolidation of computing platforms for\ndata- and compute-intensive applications are providing new opportunities to\nuse advanced scheduling and resource management techniques for higher\nutilization and energy savings. As a result, resource management policies\nthat consider the tradeoffs between energy usage and performance, throughput,\nand other QoS requirements, have become important research challenges that\nmust be addressed.\nIn this special issue, we seek original work focused on addressing new\nresearch and development challenges, consisting of developing new scheduling\ntechniques and advanced resource management solutions in green computing\nfor HPC systems.\n\nSpecific topics include, but not limited to, the following:\n*              Energy-aware task scheduling heuristics\n*              Energy-aware resource management infrastructures\n*              Thermal-aware task scheduling heuristics\n*              Thermal-aware resource management infrastructures\n*              Energy and thermal-aware scheduling for fault-tolerance\n*              Enhanced performance, energy, and thermal models for energy-\n                 aware schedulers\n*              Resource management in power/energy constrained systems\n*              Energy efficiency and virtualization\n*              Energy, performance, quality of service, and other resource\n              tradeoffs\n*              Energy-aware scheduling for heterogeneous systems\n*              Energy-aware scheduling for parallel and distributed systems\n*              Energy-efficient scheduling of hardware accelerators (FPGAs,\n              GPUs, etc.)\n*              Energy-aware scheduling for different computing paradigms:\n              cluster, grid, cloud, and datacenters\n\nSubmission Details:\nGeneral information for submitting papers to SUSCOM can be found at\nhttp://ees.elsevier.com/suscom/ (please note the \"Guide for Authors\" link).\nSubmissions to this Special Issue (SI) should be made using Elsevier's\neditorial system at the journal website\n(http://ees.elsevier.com/suscom/ , under the \"submit paper\" link).

Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"SERP: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\n   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"SERP: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper\ncategories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttp://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 4, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for originality,\nsignificance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of contradictory\nrecommendations, a member of the conference program committee would be\ncharged to make the final decision (accept/reject); often, this would involve\nseeking help from additional referees. Papers whose authors include a member\nof the conference program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\nreview process. (Papers deemed to be philosophical, essay type, or about\ncontroversial topics/applications will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe SERP'14 proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN)\nand will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The\nInstitute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for\nScientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,\nDatastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);\nand others. Though, there is no guarantee that the proceedings will also be\nincluded in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings; in the past, many of the\nproceedings of the federated congress that SERP is part of were included in\nthese databases. Therefore, we will also be sending the proceedings for\nindexing procedures to SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition\nof the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference\n(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed\nproceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference\nproceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of\nsections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nSERP is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results.

Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following\n      on the first page of your submission \"ICAI: LATE BREAKING PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"ICAI: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\n   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"ICAI: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper\ncategories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttp://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 4, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for originality,\nsignificance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of contradictory\nrecommendations, a member of the conference program committee would be\ncharged to make the final decision (accept/reject); often, this would involve\nseeking help from additional referees. Papers whose authors include a member\nof the conference program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\nreview process. (Papers deemed to be philosophical, essay type, or about\ncontroversial topics/applications will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and will\nalso be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science\ncitation databases that track citation frequency/data for each published\npaper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier indexing\nproducts (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,\nwww.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,\nwww.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for\nEngineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,\nCNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,\nEBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition\nof the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference\n(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed\nproceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference\nproceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of\nsections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\nJune 4, 2014:       Submission of papers for evaluation (the sooner, a submission\n                    is received, the earlier, the notification will be sent out.)\nJune 14, 2014:      The notification of acceptance will be sent out typically one\n                    week after the paper has been submitted.\nJune 26, 2014:      Registration\nJuly 21-24, 2014:   The 2014 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n                    (ICAI'14)\nAugust 20, 2014:    Camera-Ready Papers Due for publication\n                    (Papers submitted and accepted in response to this announcement\n                    will be published in the Final Edition of the proceedings which\n                    will go to press soon after the conference; they will also be\n                    indexed in science citation index databases.)\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nICAI is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results.

To get a feeling about the\nconferences' atmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\nhttp://worldcomp.phanfare.com/\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\nie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines.\n\nTUTORIALS:\n\nAll tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials\nthat have been approved so far can be found at:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp14/ws/tutorials\nWe plan to offer more tutorials (in addition to what is already posted on\nthe web).

Prof. David A. Patterson\n(Professor of University of California at Berkeley, member of National Academy of\nEngineering, member of National of Academy of Sciences, Fellow of IEEE, ACM, and AAAS)\nwill be opening the conference with his keynote lecture. We will have a number of\ntutorials (all tutorials are free to conference registrants) as well as tens of keynotes,\ninvited talks, together with 100's of presentations. Like other research conference,\nthe conference program/schedule will be ready one month before the start date of the\nconference (we plan to make the conference schedule vailable around June 16th).\n\nWe all look forward to seeing you at the conference in July.\n\nThank you,\nSteering Committee\n---------------------------\n\nList of co-located conferences (same dates and location; July 16-19, 2012, Las Vegas,\nUSA):\n\no.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 2012, papers published in the Congress proceedings have\nreceived over 27,000 citations (includes about 2,000 self-citations).\nCitation data obtained from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n"}, {"description": "\n\n\t Mon, 9 Feb 2015 09:51:11 -0800 (PST)\n\n\t Mon, 9 Feb 2015 09:51:11 -0800 (PST)\n\n\t Mon, 9 Feb 2015 09:51:11 -0800 (PST)\n\n\n\n\n\t    d=\"scan'208\"; a=297070576\n\n\n\t 09 Feb 2015 09:51:11 -0800\n\n\t Mon, 9 Feb 2015 12:51:07 -0500 (EST)\n\n\n on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BIOCOMP'15: July 27-30,\n 2015, Las Vegas, USA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n                         CALL  FOR  PAPERS\n\n                            BIOCOMP'15\n         The 2015 International Conference on Bioinformatics\n                     and Computational Biology\n         July 27-30, 2015, Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, USA\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/conferences/biocomp15\n\nPaper Submission Deadline: March 31, 2015\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nYou are invited to submit a paper for consideration.

Agricultural technology m=\nay be the most revolutionary and Influential area regarding modern technolo=\ngy, driven by the specific fundamental need to produce adequate food to nou=\nrish a great ever-growing population.The agricultural technology covers eve=\nrything from powered machinery to agrochemical that support crop growth and=\n protect plants from destructive weeds and insects. However, the world=E2=\n=80=99s most urgent needs are usually much more severe than these.Despite t=\nhe crisis associated with the ever-growing population, the aging of agricul=\ntural labor will be the main factor of the food crisis in the latest year. =\nThe worry of genetically modified (GMO) food and climate change has also ha=\nd great impacts on food security. The scientists are working hard to develo=\np agricultural technology to achieve the goal of serving the world=E2=80=99=\ns ever-growing population, creating a friendly and sustainable green enviro=\nnment and enabling the security of food.The Annual Conference on Engineerin=\ng and Natural Sciences (ACENS) will be held from February 5 to 7 in Bangkok=\n, Thailand, the leading country of agriculture. In the conference, the worl=\nd=E2=80=99s scholars, researchers, and professionals will discuss the urgen=\nt subjects of our agricultural industry right now, including but not restri=\ncted, the cultured meat, blockchain in the food security, biosphere and bui=\nlt environment.ACENS 2020 sincerely invites professors who are interested i=\nn the field of Agricultural Technology to submit paper related to the follo=\nwing topics:- Agricultural Safety- Cultured Meat- Biosphere- Ecosystems- Bu=\nilt Environment- Sustainable Agriculture- Livestock BiometricsProfessors ar=\ne also welcomed to submit paper related but not limited to the following ar=\neas and topics:Engineering- Biological Engineering- Chemical Engineering- E=\nnvironmental Engineering- Power & Energy EngineeringNatural Sciences- Biolo=\ngy- Chemistry- Physics- Earth SciencesLocal HostDr. Mayura SoonweraAssociat=\ne ProfessorKing Mongkut's Institute of Technology LadkrabangBangkok, Thaila=\nndWelcome Messageshttp://acens-conf.orgEmail: acens@acens-conf.org =20\n\n    You are currently subscribed to our list with the following address: fo=\naad@calpoly.edu.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n"}, {"description": "\n\nThe Second International Conference on Digital Enterprise and Information\nSystems (DEIS 2013)\nAsia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU), Kuala Lumpur,\nMalaysia\n                                        March 4-6, 2013\n                         http://sdiwc.net/conferences/2013/Malaysia1/\n========================================================================\n\nThe proposed conference on the above theme will be held at Asia Pacific\nUniversity of Technology and Innovation (APU), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, From\nMarch 4-6, 2013 which aims to enable researchers build connections between\ndifferent digital applications.\n\nThe conference welcomes papers on the following (but not limited to)\nresearch topics:\n\n- Information Ethics\n- Information Content Security\n- Data Compression\n- E-Technology\n- E-Government\n- E-Learning\n- Cloud Computing\n- Grid Computing\n- Green Computing\n- Access Controls\n- Data Mining\n- Social Search\n- Computer Forensics\n- Computer Security\n- Peer-to-Peer Social Networks\n- Information and Data Management\n- Peer-to-Peer Networks\n- Network Security\n- Social Networks\n- Real-Time Systems\n- Internet Modeling\n- Assurance of Service\n- Image Processing\n- Web Services Security\n- Multimedia Computing\n- Software Engineeing\n- Biometrics Technologies\n- Wireless Communications\n- Semantic Web, Ontologies\n- Mobile Social Networks\n- Anti cyberterrorism\n- XML-Based Languages\n- Soft Computing Techniques\n- Computational Intelligence\n- Mobile Networking, Mobility and Nomadicity\n- Ubiquitous Computing, Services and Applications\n- Forensics, Recognition Technologies and Applications\n- Fuzzy and Neural Network Systems\n- Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Applications\n- Distributed and Parallel Applications\n- User Interfaces,Visualization and Modeling\n- Mobile, Ad Hoc and Sensor Network Management\n- Web Services Architecture, Modeling and Design\n- Quality of Service, Scalability and Performance\n- Self-Organizing Networks and Networked Systems\n- Data Management in Mobile\n- Data Stream Processing in Mobile/Sensor Networks\n- Indexing and Query Processing for Moving Objects\n- User Interfaces and Usability Issues form Mobile Applications\n- Sensor Networks and Social Sensing\n- Embedded Systems and Software\n- Information Propagation on Social Networks\n- Resource and Knowledge Discovery Using Social Networks\n- Computer Crime Prevention and Detection\n- Confidentiality Protection\n- Critical Infrastructure Management\n- Critical Computing and Storage\n- Cryptography and Data Protection\n\n\nResearchers are encouraged to submit their work electronically.

What are the conditions of possibility of games being art?=\n How do computer games fit into established categories or conventions of ae=\nsthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as ha=\nving a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do accoun=\nts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against ant=\ni-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games?=20\n\n3. The aesthetics of gaming practices. Are games collaboratively authored? =\nHow do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring about di=\nfferent kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do differen=\nt bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in whi=\nch gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?=20\nDo some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aesthetic=\n orientation? Are computer games performances?=20\n\n4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics. What i=\ns the transformative potential of computer games and how does this compare =\nto the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do aesthetic i=\nssues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones =E2=80=93 what =\nis the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sensi=\nbility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the social=\n implications of this?=20\n\nIn addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open cat=\negory, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this year=\n=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the=\n philosophy of computer games.=20\n\nSubmitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and philosophic=\nal (including media philosophical) issues in relation to computer games. Th=\ney should also refer to specific games rather than invoke them in more gene=\nral terms. Submissions should be made in the form of extended abstracts of =\nup to 1000 words (excluding bibliography). Please indicate if you intend yo=\nur paper to fit in the open category. The deadline for submissions is 23:59=\n GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019. Please submit your abstract through review=\n.gamephilosophy.org. All submitted abstracts will be subject to a double-bl=\nind peer review process.=20\n\nNotification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late August 2019. =\nA full paper draft must then be submitted by Monday, 14th October 2019 and =\nwill be made available on the conference website.=20\n\nWe also invite proposals for themed panels and workshops that will take pla=\nce on the 20th and 24th October, 2019. Please contact the program committee=\n chair if you are interested in organising one.=20\n\nWe cannot provide grants or subsidies for participants. There will, however=\n, be no conference fee.\n\nFor more information about the conference please visit http://gameconferenc=\ne.mediaphilosophy.ru/pcg2019.html and gamephilosophy.org.=20\n\n\nVisa information\n\nPlease note that you may need to obtain a visa to enter Russia.=20\n\nIf you need a visa you should apply for it at the Russian consulate in your=\n country or at the visa service (the most popular is VisaGlobal). All visa =\nservices have an additional fee. St. Petersburg State University provides a=\nttendees with an invitation letter, which helps to obtain the humanitarian =\nvisa. Normally the costs of the humanitarian visa is less than the tourist =\nor business one (for German and Polish citizens, for instance, the humanita=\nrian visa is free if they apply for it in the consulate).=20\n\nThe cost of visas varies from country to country. Here is a list of some co=\nuntries.=20\n\nAll the information concerning the visa costs and the processing time (norm=\nally it takes from 4 to 20 days, depending on the country) is available her=\ne: https://www.vfsglobal.com.

LATE BREAKING PAPERS: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the\n      following on the first page of your submission \"name of conference:\n      LATE BREAKING PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-\n      Ready paper will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and\n      the author will be given the opportunity to present the paper in a\n      formal session.\n\n   2. POSITION PAPERS: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 5. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"name of conference: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be\n      limited to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be\n      given the opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   3. ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPERS: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission \"name of\n      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the\n      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE\n      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to\n      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable\n(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a\nparticular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication; these formatting instructions appear at:\nhttp://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style\nformat). Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. All proceedings are also approved for inclusion into\nEBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The\ntitles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes\nbibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books.

All accepted papers\nwill be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN) and will\nalso be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science\ncitation databases that track citation frequency/data. In addition, like\nprior years, extended versions of selected papers (about 35%) of the\nconference will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers\ninclude: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others); some of these books and\njournal special issues have already received the top 25% downloads in\ntheir respective fields. See the link below for a very small subset of\nthe books published mostly based on extended versions of the accepted\npapers of this congress:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/publications \nThe titles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes bibliographic\ncitations from major publishers in computing.\n\nThe Congress is composed of a number of tracks (joint-conferences, tutorials,\nsessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions); all will be held\nsimultaneously, same location and dates: July 27-30, 2015. For the complete\nlist of joint conferences, see below.\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF DRAFT PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and\nreferences.) All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later,\nthe authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular\ntypesetting format to prepare their final papers for publication; these\nformatting instructions appear at: http://world-comp.org and they conform\nto the two-column IEEE style format). Papers must not have been previously\npublished or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The first\npage of the paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,\npostal address, and email address for each author as well as a maximum\nof 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\nThe first page should also identify the name of the Contact/Corresponding\nauthor together with his/her professional email address. A 100 to\n150-word abstract should appear on the first page. Authors are to\nconform to the common CODE OF ETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the\nCode of Ethics is available on the submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The printed proceedings/books will\nbe available for distribution on site at the conference. The proceedings\nwill be indexed in science citation databases that track citation\nfrequency/data for each published paper. The proceedings/books of this\ncongress have been evaluated for inclusion into major science citation\nindex databases. We are happy to report that so far, the evaluation\nboard of science citation index databases have approved the indexing,\nintegrating, and inclusion of the following conference tracks into\nrelevant indexing databases (indexing databases include, among others:\nScopus, Engineering Village, EMBASE, and others): BIOCOMP, DMIN, GCA,\nICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA, and SAM.

Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"GCA: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for\npaper categories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttp://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 2, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed\nto be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications\nwill not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier\nindexing products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,\nwww.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,\nwww.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for\nEngineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,\nCNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,\nEBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final\nEdition of the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the\nconference (the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship\nthe printed proceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the\nconference proceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a\nnumber of sections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity\nto submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration\nin these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each\nof these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,\nEi village, SCI, ...).\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nGCA is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results.\nIt is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of\nother research conferences; namely, The 2013 World Congress in Computer\nScience, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is\nthe largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science,\ncomputer engineering and applied computing.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS:\n\nPartial list of tutorials:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/tutorials\n\nPartial list of keynotes:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/keynotes\n\nLocation of the conference:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/location\n\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of March 14, 2013, papers published in the congress proceedings that\nGCA is part of, have received 27,591 citations (includes 3,342\nself-citations).

The\nconductance of properly engineered memristors can be continuously tuned\nwith relatively large electrical bias, and retained, effectively\nindefinitely, when small stress is applied. Such analog nonvolatile memory\nfunctionality and extremely high device density achieved by lateral scaling\nand/or monolithical vertical integration enable many new exciting\napplications of memristors in neuromorphic and alternative types of\ncomputing.\n\nIn my talk, I will review several such applications based on metal-oxide\nmemristors which were a recent focus of my group. This includes stateful\nmaterial implication logic, which was originally suggested by Hewlett\nPackard Laboratories group. In our work, we showed that 3D version of this\nlogic allows resolving Feynman grand challenge of implementing 8-bit adder\nin a volume smaller than 50-nm cube. I will also review our experimental\nwork on memristor-based security primitives, in which we utilized device\nvariations and their nonlinear I-Vs to demonstrate functionality and\nphysical performance superior to those of conventional approaches. Finally,\nI will discuss applications of memristors in neuromorphic computing,\noutlining some of my group=E2=80=99s recent experimental work on mixed-sign=\nal\nfiring-rate neural networks, which have a potential to greatly exceed\nconventional implementations in energy efficiency, speed, and density, and\nspiking neural networks, that allow for compact implementation of training\nalgorithms in the hardware.\n[image: image.png]\n\n*Dmitri B.
